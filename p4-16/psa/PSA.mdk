~ Begin Abstract

P4 is a language for expressing how packets are processed by the data
plane of a programmable network forwarding element. P4 programs
specify how the various programmable blocks of a target architecture
are programmed and connected.  The Portable Switch Architecture (PSA)
is target architecture that describes common capabilities of network
switch devices which process and forward packets across multiple
interface ports.

~ End Abstract

# Target Architecture Model


The Portable Switch Architecture (PSA) Model has six programmable P4
blocks and two fixed-function blocks, as shown in Figure
[#fig-switch]. Programmable blocks are hardware blocks whose function
can be programmed using the P4 language. The Packet buffer and
Replication Engine (PRE) and the Buffer Queuing Engine (BQE) are
target dependent functional blocks that may be configured for a fixed
set of operations.

Incoming packets are parsed and validated, and
then passed to an ingress match action pipeline, which makes decisions
on where the packets go. After the ingress pipeline, the packet
may be buffered and/or replicated (sent to multiple egress ports). For
each such egress port, the packet passes through an egress match
action pipeline before it is
deparsed and queued to leave the pipeline. Note: the checksum
operations are available -- validation in the parser,
and checksum computation and update in deparser (see also
Table [#table-extern-usage]).

A programmer targeting the PSA is required to instantiate objects for
the programmable blocks that conform to these APIs (see section
[#sec-programmable-blocks]).  Note that the programmable block APIs
are templatized on user defined headers and metadata. In PSA, the user
can define a single metadata type for all controls.

When instantiating the `main` `package` object, the instances
corresponding to the programmable blocks are passed as arguments.


# Naming conventions

In this document we use the following naming conventions:

- Types are named using CamelCase followed by `_t`. For example, `PortId_t`.
- Control types and extern object types are named using CamelCase. For
example `IngressParser`.
- Struct types are named using lower case words separated by `_`
  followed by `_t`. For example `psa_ingress_input_metadata_t`.
- Actions, extern methods, extern functions, headers, structs, and
  instances of controls and externs start with lower case and words
  are separated using `_`. For example `send_to_port`.
- Enum members, const definitions, and #define constants are all
  caps, with words separated by `_`. For example `PORT_CPU`.

Architecture specific metadata (e.g. structs) are prefixed by `psa_`.


# Packet paths {#packet-paths}

Figure [#fig-packet-paths] shows all possible paths for packets that
must be supported by a PSA implementation.  An implementation is
allowed to support paths for packets that are not described here.

Table [#packet-path-abbreviations] defines the meanings of the
abbreviations in Figure [#fig-packet-paths].  There can be one or more
hardware, software, or PSA architecture components between the "packet
source" and "packet destination" given in that table, e.g. a normal
multicast packet passes through the packet replication engine and
typically also a packet buffer after leaving the ingress deparser,
before arriving at the egress parser.  This table focuses on the
P4-programmable portions of the architecture as sources and
destinations of these packet paths.

happen to a packet as a result of a single time being processed in
ingress, or a single time being processed in egress.  The cases are
the same as shown in Table [#packet-path-abbreviations], but have been
grouped together by similar values of "Processed next by".

There are metadata fields defined by PSA that enable your P4 program
to identify which path each packet arrived on, and to control where it
will go next.  See section [#packet-path-details].

For egress packets, the choice of egress port, or the port to the CPU,
is made by the immediately previous processing step (ingress for NU,
NM, or CI2E packets, egress for CE2E packets), and egress processing
cannot change that choice to a different port.  It can change the
packet to RECIRC instead, or drop the packet.  Ingress code is the
intended place in your P4 program where the output port(s) are chosen.

A single packet received by a PSA system from a port can result in 0,
1, or many packets going out, all under control of the P4 program.
For example, a single packet received from a port could cause all of
the following to occur, if the P4 program so directed it:

+ The original packet received as NFP from port 2.  Ingress processing
  creates a CI2E clone destined for the CPU port (copy 1), and a
  multicast NM packet to multicast group 18, which is configured in
  the PacketReplicationEngine to have copies made to ports 5 (copy 2)
  and 7 (copy 3).
+ Copy 1 performs egress processing, which sends the packet on path
  NTCPU to the CPU port.
+ Copy 2 performs egress processing, which creates a CE2E clone
  destined for port 8 (copy 4), and sends a NTP packet to port 5.
+ Copy 3 performs egress processing, which does a RECIRC back to
  ingress instead of sending the packet to port 7 (copy 5).
+ Copy 4 performs egress processing, which sends a NTP packet to port
  8.
+ Copy 5 performs ingress processing, which sends a NU packet destined
  for port 1 (copy 6).
+ Copy 6 performs egress processing, which drops the packet instead of
  sending it to port 1.

This is simply an example of what is possible given an appropriately
written P4 program.  There is no need to use all of the packet paths
available.  The numbering of the packet copies above is only for
purposes of distinctly identifying each one in the example.  The ports
described in the example are also arbitrary. A PSA
implementation is free to perform the steps above in many possible
orders.

There is no mandated mechanism in PSA to prevent a single received
packet from creating packets that continue to recirculate, resubmit,
or clone from egress to egress indefinitely.  This can be prevented by
suitable testing of your P4 program, and/or creating in your P4
program a "time to live" metadata field that is carried along with
copies of a packet, similar to the IPv4 Time To Live header field.

A PSA implementation may optionally drop resubmitted, recirculated, or
egress-to-egress clone packets after an implementation-specific
maximum number of times from the same original packet.  If so, the
implementation should maintain counters of packets dropped for these
reasons, and preferably record some debug information about the first
few packets dropped for these reasons (perhaps only one).


# PSA Data types

## PSA type definitions

Each PSA implementation will have specific bit widths for the
following types.  These widths should be defined in the target
specific implementation of the PSA file.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Type_defns]
```

## PSA supported metadata types

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_types]
```

## Match kinds

Additional supported match_kind types

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Match_kinds]
```


# Programmable blocks {#sec-programmable-blocks}

The following declarations provide a template for the programmable
blocks in the PSA. The P4 programmer is responsible for
implementing controls that match these interfaces and instantiate
them in a package definition.

It uses the same user-defined metadata type `IM` and header type `IH`
for all ingress parsers and control blocks.  The egress parser and
control blocks can use the same types for those things, or different
types, as the P4 program author wishes.

# Packet Path Details {#packet-path-details}

Refer to section [#packet-paths] for the packet paths provided by PSA,
and their abbreviated names, used often in this section.


## Initial values of packets processed by ingress

Table [#ingress-initial-values] describes the initial values of the
packet contents and metadata when a packet begins ingress processing.

|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----|
~

Note that the `ingress_port` value for a resubmitted packet could be
`PORT_RECIRCULATE` if a packet was recirculated, and then that
recirculated packet was resubmitted.

### Initial packet contents for packets from ports

For Ethernet ports, `packet_in` for FP and NFCPU path packets contains
the Ethernet frame starting with the Ethernet header.  It does not
include the Ethernet frame CRC.

~ TBD
Whether the payload is always the
minimum of 46 bytes (64 byte minimum Ethernet frame size, minus 14
bytes of header, minus 4 bytes of CRC), or whether an implementation
is allowed to leave some of those bytes out.}
~

The PSA does not put further restrictions on `packet_in.length()`
as defined in the P4~16~ spec. Targets that do not support it, should provide mechanisms
to raise an error.

### Initial packet contents for resubmitted packets

For RESUB packets, `packet_in` is the same as the pre-IngressParser
contents of `packet_in`, for the packet that caused this resubmitted
packet to occur (i.e. with NO modifications from any ingress processing).  Truncation is not supported for RESUB packets.

### Initial packet contents for recirculated packets

For RECIRC packets, `packet_in` is created by starting with the
headers emitted by the egress deparser of the egress packet that was
recirculated, followed by the payload of that packet, i.e. the part
that was not parsed by the egress parser.  Truncation is not supported
for RECIRC packets.

### User-defined metadata for all ingress packets

The PSA architecture does not mandate initialization of user-defined
metadata to known values as given as input to the ingress parser.  If
a user's P4 program explicitly initializes all user-defined metadata
early on (e.g. in the parser's `start` state), then that will flow
through the rest of the parser into the `Ingress`  control block as one
might normally expect.  This will be left as an option to the user in
their P4 programs, not required behavior for all P4 programs.

~TBD
Is this true for RESUB and RECIRC packets, or is it intended that
there by a way in PSA to specify some collection of fields to be
preserved with a resub/recirc'ed packet?
~

## Behavior of packets after ingress processing is complete {#sec-after-ingress}

The pseudocode below defines where copies of packets will be made
after the `Ingress` control block has completed executing, based upon
the contents of several metadata fields in the struct
`psa_ingress_output_metadata_t`.

The function `platform_port_valid()` mentioned below takes a value of
type `PortId_t`, returning `true` only when the value represents an
output port for the implementation.  It is expected that for some PSA
implementations there will be bit patterns for a value of type
`PortId_t` that do not correspond to any port.  This function returns
true for `PORT_CPU`, but false for `PORT_RECIRCULATE`.
`PORT_RECIRCULATE` is only intended as a value for `ingress_port` when
ingress processing begins for a recirculated packet (see Table
[#ingress-initial-values].  See section [#sec-after-egress] for how P4
programs cause a packet to be recirculated). `platform_port_valid`
is not defined in PSA for calling from the P4 data-plane
program, since there is no known use case for calling it at packet
processing time. It is intended for describing the behavior in pseudo-code.
The control plane is expected to configure tables
with valid port numbers.

A comment saying "recommended to log error" is not a requirement, but
a recommendation, that a PSA implementation should maintain a counter
that counts the number of times this error occurs.  It would also be
useful if the implementation recorded details about the first few
times this error occurred, e.g. a FIFO queue of the first several
invalid values of `ostd.egress_port` that cause an error to occur,
perhaps with other information about the packet that caused it, with
tail dropping if it fills up.  Control plane or driver software would
be able to read these counters, and read and drain the FIFO queues to
assist P4 developers in debugging their code.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_ingress_output]

    psa_ingress_output_metadata_t ostd;

    if (ostd.class_of_service value is not supported) {
        ostd.class_of_service = 0;    // use default class 0 instead
        // Recommended to log error about unsupported
        // ostd.class_of_service value.
    }
    if (ostd.truncate) {
        Truncate the payload to at most ostd.truncate_payload_bytes long.
            This affects any copies made below except resubmitted
            packets, which are not required to support truncation.
    }
    if (ostd.clone) {
        if (ostd.clone_class_of_service value is not supported) {
            ostd.clone_class_of_service = 0;
            // Recommmended to log error about unsupported
            // ostd.clone_class_of_service value.
        }
        if (platform_port_valid(ostd.clone_port)) {
            create a clone of the packet and send it to the packet
                buffer with class of service ostd.clone_class_of_service,
                after which it will start egress processing.
        } else {
            // Do not create a clone.  Recommended to log error about
            // unsupported ostd.clone_port value.
        }
    }
    // Continue below, regardless of whether a clone was created.
    // Any clone created above is unaffected by the code below.
    if (ostd.drop) {
        drop the packet
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (ostd.resubmit) {
        resubmit the packet, i.e. it will go back to starting with the
            ingress parser;
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (ostd.multicast_group != 0) {
        Make 0 or more copies of the packet according to the control
            plane configuration of multicast group ostd.multicast_group.
            Every copy will have the same value of ostd.class_of_service
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (platform_port_valid(ostd.egress_port)) {
        enqueue one packet for output port ostd.egress_port with class
            of service ostd.class_of_service
    } else {
        drop the packet
        // Recommended to log error about unsupported ostd.egress_port
        // value.
    }
```

Note: Truncation is not currently supported for cloned packets. The functionality of a truncated
cloned packet can be replaced with sending a digest.

~TBD

If it is planned to be possible at the end of ingress to send a
packet to be replicated via a multicast_group, and also have a copy go
to the control CPU, give an example showing this case (after showing
some simpler common cases).  Ideally it should be possible for the
copy going to the control CPU to have a software-defined header
(defined in the P4 program) that is different than any headers on the
packet copies going to the `Egress` control block.
~

Whenever the pseudocode above indicates that a packet should be sent
on a particular packet path, a PSA implementation may under some
circumstances instead drop the packet.  For example, the packet buffer
may be too low on available space for storing new packets, or some
other congestion control mechanism such as RED (Random Early
Detection) or AFD (Approximate Fair Dropping) may select the packet
for dropping.  It is recommended that an implementation maintain
counters of packets dropped, preferably with separate counters for as
many different reasons as the implementation has for dropping packets
outside the control of the P4 program.

A PSA implementation may implement multiple classes of service for
packets sent to the packet buffer.  If so, the `Ingress` control block
may choose to assign a value to the `ostd.class_of_service` field to
change the packet's class of service to a value other than the default
of 0.

PSA only specifies how the `Ingress` control block can control the class
of service of packets.  PSA does not mandate a scheduling policy among
queues that may exist in the packet buffer.  Something at least as
flexible as weighted fair queuing, with an optional strict high
priority queue, is recommended for PSA implementations with separate
queues for each class of service.

Normally all unicast packets (i.e. those that follow the "enqueue one
packet" path in the pseudocode above) received by a PSA device on the
same ingress port, and sent to the same output port, will be processed
by the `Ingress` control block in the same order they are received, and
then processed by the `Egress` control bock in the same relative order as they
are processed by the `Ingress` control block, i.e. all such packets go
through the same FIFO queue in the packet buffer.

It is expected that some PSA implementations will implement the class
of service mechanism by having a separate FIFO queue per class of
service, and thus while unicast packets with the same ingress port,
egress port, and class of service will pass through the system in FIFO
order, unicast packets with the same ingress and egress port, but
different classes of service, may be processed by the `Egress` control
block in a different order than they were processed by the Ingress
control block.

All of the above is also true for multicast packets (i.e. those that
follow the "Make 0 or more copies" path in the pseudocode above) that
are received on the same input port and their copies are made to the same
output port, at least during times when the multicast group
memberships are stable (i.e. it has been a significant time since
the control plane has updated the multicast group
configuration).  As for unicast packets, multicast packets with the
same ingress port and replicated using the same value of
`ostd.multicast_group`, but different values of
`ostd.class_of_service`, are expected that they may be processed by
the `Egress` control block in a different order than they were processed
by the `Ingress` control block.

The control plane API excerpt below is an example intended to be added as part of
the P4 Runtime API, and the final version of this message will be defined
by the P4 Runtime WG.

```
// The ClassOfServiceInfo message should be added to the "oneof"
// inside of message "Entity".

// ClassOfServiceInfo is only intended to be read.  Attempts to update
// this entity have no effect, and should return an error status that
// the entity is read only.

message ClassOfServiceInfo {
  // The number of class of service queues per output port that are
  // available in this PSA implementation.
  uint32 class_of_service_queues_per_output_port = 1;
  // The list of values of type ClassOfService_t that are supported by
  // this PSA implementation.  It is recommended that they be a
  // contiguous range from 0 up to
  // (class_of_service_queues_per_output_port - 1).
  repeated uint32 class_of_service_id = 2;
}
```


## Actions for directing packets during ingress {#sec-ingress-actions}

All of these actions modify one or more metadata fields in the struct
with type `psa_ingress_output_metadata_t` that is an `out` parameter
of the `Ingress` control block.  None of these actions has any other
immediate effect.  What happens to the packet is determined by the
value of all fields in that struct when ingress processing is
complete, not at the time one of these actions is called.  See Section
[#sec-after-ingress].

These actions are provided for convenience in making changes to these
metadata fields.  Their effects are expected to be common kinds of
changes one will want to make in a P4 program.  If they do not suit
your use cases, you are of course welcome to modify the metadata
fields directly in your P4 programs however you prefer, perhaps within
actions you define yourself.


### Unicast operation

Sends packet to a port.  See Table [#egress-initial-values], column
NU, for how metadata fields are filled in when such a packet begins
egress processing.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_send_to_port]
```

### Multicast operation

Sends packet to a multicast group or a port.  See Table
[#egress-initial-values], column NM, for how metadata fields are
filled in when each multicast-replicated copy of such a packet begins
egress processing.

The multicast_group parameter is the multicast group id. The control
plane must configure the multicast groups through a separate
mechanism such as the P4 Runtime API.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_multicast]
```

### Drop operation

Do not send a copy of the packet for normal egress processing.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_ingress_drop]
```

### Truncate operation {#sec-ingress-truncate}

For all copies of the packet made at the end of ingress processing,
truncate the payload to be at most the specified number of bytes.
Specifying 0 is legal, and causes only packet headers to be sent, with
no payload.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_ingress_truncate]
```

### Initial packet contents for normal packets

For NU and NM packets, `packet_in` comes from the ingress packet that
caused this packet to be sent to egress.  It starts with the packet
headers as emitted by the ingress deparser, followed by the payload of
that packet, i.e. the part that was not parsed by the ingress parser.
Truncation of the payload is supported.

### Initial packet contents for packets cloned from ingress to egress

For CI2E packets, `packet_in` is from the ingress packet that caused
this clone to be created.  It is the same as the pre-IngressParser
contents of `packet_in` of that ingress packet, with no modifications
from any ingress processing.  Truncation of the payload is supported.


### Initial packet contents for packets cloned from egress to egress

For CE2E packets, `packet_in` is from the egress packet that caused this
clone to be created.  It starts with the headers emitted by the egress
deparser, followed by the payload of that packet, i.e. the part that
was not parsed by the egress parser.  Truncation of the payload is
supported.


### User-defined metadata for all egress packets

Pending discussion of bridged metadata, and how clone packets may
be able to carry metadata with them (see [#sec-open-metadata]).


### Multicast copies

The following fields may differ among copies of a multicast-replicated
packet that are processed in egress.

+ `egress_port` - This field will typically differ among copies of a
  multicast-replicated packet, but it may also be the same for
  arbitrary copies, as determined by the control plane configuration
  of the PacketReplicationEngine.  It is expected that the control
  plane will configure the PacketReplicationEngine so that each copy
  of the same original packet is assigned a unique value of the pair
  `(egress_port, instance)`.
+ `instance` - See `egress_port`
+ `egress_timestamp` - This value is filled in independently for each
  copy of a multicast-replicated packet.  Depending upon the quantity
  of traffic destined to each output port, the timestamp could vary
  significantly between copies of the same original packet.
+ `parser_error` - In the common case, this will typically be the same
  for every copy of the same original multicast-replicated packet.
  However, it is determined by the EgressParser P4 code for each copy
  independently, so if that parsing behavior depends upon a field that
  can differ among copies, e.g. `egress_port`, then `parser_error`
  can differ among copies.

All contents of a packet and its associated metadata, other than those
mentioned above, will be the same for every copy of the same original
multicast-replicated packet.


## Behavior of packets after egress processing is complete {#sec-after-egress}


The pseudocode below defines where copies of packets will be made
after the `Egress` control block has completed executing, based upon
the contents of several metadata fields in the struct
`psa_egress_output_metadata_t`.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_egress_output]

    psa_egress_input_metadata_t  istd;
    psa_egress_output_metadata_t ostd;

    if (ostd.truncate) {
        Truncate the payload to at most truncate_payload_bytes long.
            This affects any copies made below except recirculated
            packets, which are not required to support truncation.
    }
    if (ostd.clone) {
        if (ostd.clone_class_of_service value is not supported) {
            ostd.clone_class_of_service = 0;
            // Recommmended to log error about unsupported
            // ostd.clone_class_of_service value.
        }
        if (platform_port_valid(ostd.clone_port)) {
            create a copy of the packet and send it to the packet
                buffer with class of service specified by
                ostd.clone_class_of_service, after which it will start
                egress processing.
        } else {
            // Do not create a clone.  Recommended to log error about
            // unsupported ostd.clone_port value.
        }
    }
    // Continue below, regardless of whether a clone was created.
    // Any clone created above is unaffected by the code below.
    if (ostd.drop) {
        drop the packet
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (ostd.recirculate) {
        recirculate the packet, i.e. it will go back to starting with the
            ingress parser;
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }

    // The value istd.egress_port below is the same one that the
    // packet began its egress processing with, as decided during
    // ingress processing for this packet.  The egress code is not
    // allowed to change it.
    enqueue one packet for output port istd.egress_port
```

~TBD
Should it be possible to truncate a cloned packet differently
than the normal packet that goes out?
~

As for the handling of a packet after ingress processing, a PSA
implementation may drop a packet after egress processing, even if the
pseudocode above says that a packet will be sent.  For example, you
may attempt to clone a packet after egress when the packet buffer is
too full, or you may attempt to recirculate a packet when the ingress
pipeline is busy handling other packets.  It is recommended that an
implementation maintain counters of packets dropped, preferably with
separate counters for as many different reasons as the implementation
has for dropping packets outside the control of the P4 program.


## Actions for directing packets during egress {#sec-egress-actions}

### Drop operation {#sec-bqe-drop}

Do not send the packet out of the device after egress processing is
complete.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_egress_drop]
```

### Truncate operation {#sec-egress-truncate}

For all copies of the packet made at the end of egress processing,
truncate the payload to be at most the specified number of bytes.
Specifying 0 is legal, and causes only packet headers to be sent, with
no payload.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_egress_truncate]
```


## Contents of packets sent out to ports

There is no metadata associated with NTP and NTCPU packets.

They begin with the series of bytes emitted by the egress deparser.
Following that is the payload, which are those packet bytes that were
not parsed in the egress parser.  Truncation is supported for these
packets.

For Ethernet ports, any padding required to get the packet up to the
minimum frame size required is done by the implementation, as well as
calculation of and appending the Ethernet frame CRC.

It is expected that typical P4 programs will have explicit checks to
avoid sending packets larger than a port's maximum frame size.  A
typical implementation will drop frames larger than this maximum
supported size.  It is recommended that they maintain error counters
for such dropped frames.


## Clone, Recirculate, Resubmit

Figure [#fig-clone] shows the proposed architectures for clone,
recirculate, and resubmit in PSA.


## Packet Cloning  {#sec-clone}

Packet cloning is a mechanism to send a copy of a packet to a
specified port, and is often synonymous with packet mirroring. In PSA cloning
is represented as an extern `clone_out`.

Packet cloning happens at the end of the ingress and/or egress pipeline.
PSA specifies the following semantics for clone operation. When the
clone operation is invoked at the end of the ingress pipeline, the
cloned packet is a copy of the original packet from ingress port. When
the clone operation is invoked at the end of egress pipeline, the
cloned packet is a copy of the modified packet after egress processing.
In both cases, the cloned packet is submitted to the
egress pipeline for further processing.

Logically, PRE implements the mechanics of copying a packet. PRE reads
the original packet from ingress port and the modified packet from
egress deparser. PRE then decides which version of the packet to use
to generate a copy based on the value of the metadata provided by the
ingress and egress pipeline. Two sets of configuration metadata are
provided to the PRE, one from each pipeline. The cloning metadata is:

```
bool              clone;
PortId_t          clone_port;
ClassOfService_t  clone_class_of_service;
```

The `clone` bit specifies whether a packet should be cloned in the
specific pipeline. If the bit is true, then the cloned packet should
be generated at the end of the pipeline. The `clone_port` specifies
which port to send the cloned packet to after egress processing. The
`clone_port` could be any addressable port in the pipeline. For
instance, it can be a port to control CPU or a port to the next hop
router.

~ TBD
Decide how to add other metadata to the cloned packet (see [#sec-open-metadata]).
~

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Clone_extern]
```

### Clone Examples {#sec-clone-examples}

The partial program below demonstrates one way to use the `clone_out`
extern to configure the PRE to create a copy of the packet and send
the cloned copy to `clone_port`.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part1]
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part2]
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part3]
```

## Packet Resubmission  {#sec-resubmit}

Packet resubmission is a mechanism to repeat ingress processing on a
packet.

If a packet is resubmitted, it re-enters the ingress parser after the
ingress pipeline processing. The `ingress_port` of the resubmitted
packet is the same as the original packet, however, the
`instance_type` of the resubmitted packet is changed to `RESUBMIT`.
The resubmitted packet has the same header and payload as the original
packet.

The ingress parser is able to distinguish between the original packet
and the resubmitted packet using the `instance_type` field in
`ingress_parser_intrinsic_metadata_t`. The ingress parser is allowed
to choose a different algorithm to parse the resubmitted packet.
Similarly, the ingress pipeline can choose to process the resubmitted
packet with different actions as opposed to the ones used to process
the original packet.

PSA specifies that the resubmit operation can only be used in the ingress pipeline. The egress
pipeline cannot resubmit packets. As described in Section [#packet-paths], there is no mandated
mechanism in PSA to prevent a single received packet from creating packets that continue to
recirculate, resubmit, or clone from egress to egress indefinitely. However, targets may impose
limits on the number of resubmissions, recirculations, or clones.

Packet resubmission is intended to increase the capacity and
 flexibility of the packet processing pipeline. For example, because
 the same packet is processed by the ingress pipeline multiple times,
 it effectively increase the amount of operations on the packet by N
 folds, where N is the number of times the packet is resubmitted.
 Another use case is deploy multiple packet processing algorithms on
 the same packet. For example, the original packet can be parsed,
 modified and resubmitted in the first pass. Then, the resubmitted
 packet can be parsed and modified using a different algorithm.

To facilitate communication between the first pass and the second pass
through the ingress pipeline, the resubmission mechanism supports
attaching optional metadata with the resubmitted packet. The metadata
is generated during the first pass through the ingress pipeline, and
used in the second pass. See Section [#sec-open-metadata] for the
discussion.

A PSA implementation provides a configuration bit `resubmit` to the
PRE to enable the resubmission mechanism. If `resubmit` is set to
true, the resubmission mechanism resends the original packet with the
optional attached metadata. If `resubmit` is set to false, the
resubmission mechanism is disabled and the original packet is not
resubmitted even if the `add_metadata` method is invoked in the
deparser.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Resubmit_extern]

```

## Packet Recirculation {#sec-recirculate}

Packet recirculation sends the deparsed packet at the end of egress
pipeline to the ingress parser. Unlike the previous two mechanisms,
recirculation does not replicate packets. The modified packet itself
is sent back to the ingress pipeline for further processing.

In PSA, recirculation is controlled by the `recirculate` bit in the
egress pipeline. If the `recirculate` bit is set to true, the modified
packet at the end of the pipeline is sent to a special recirculation
port. The recirculation port overrides the value in `egress_port`.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Recirculate_extern]

```

Users can leverage the existing `emit` methods in `packet_out` to
attach additional metadata to the recirculated packet. Upon receiving
the recirculated packet in ingress parser, the `instance_type` of the
recirculated packet is set to `RECIRCULATE`. It is the user's
responsibility to parse the recirculated packet correctly.


# PSA Externs

## Restrictions on where externs may be used {#sec-extern-restrictions}

All instantiations in a P4~16~ program occur at compile time, and can
be arranged in a tree structure we will call the instantiation tree.
The root of the tree `T` represents the top level of the program.  Its
children are the node for the package `PSA_Switch` described in
Section [#sec-programmable-blocks], and any externs instantiated at
the top level of the program.  The children of the `PSA_Switch` node
are the packages and externs passed as parameters to the `PSA_Switch`
instantiation.  See Figure [#fig-instantiation-tree] for a drawing of
the smallest instantiation tree possible for a P4 program written for
PSA.

~ Figure {#fig-instantiation-tree; caption: "Minimal PSA instantiation tree"; page-align: here;}
![instantiation-tree]
~
[instantiation-tree]: figs/psa-instantiation-tree-figure.png { width: 100%;}


If any of those parsers or controls instantiate other parsers,
controls, and/or externs, the instantiation tree contains child nodes
for them, continuing until the instantiation tree is complete.

For every instance whose node is a descendant of the `Ingress` node in
this tree, call it an `Ingress` instance.  Similarly for the other
ingress and egress parsers and controls.  All other instances are top
level instances.

A PSA implementation is allowed to reject programs that instantiate
externs, or attempt to call their methods, from anywhere other than
the places mentioned in Table [#table-extern-usage].

~ TableFigure {#table-extern-usage; \
  caption: Summary of controls that can instantiate and invoke externs.}
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Extern type       | Where it may be instantiated and called from |
+:------------------+:---------------------------------------------+
| `ActionProfile`   | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ActionSelector`  | Ingress, Egress |

~

For example, `Counter` being restricted to "Ingress, Egress" means
that every `Counter` instance must be instantiated within either the
`Ingress` control block or the `Egress` control block, or be a descendant
of one of those nodes in the instantiation tree.  If a `Counter`
instance is instantiated in Ingress, for example, then it cannot be
referenced, and thus its methods cannot be called, from any control
block except `Ingress` or one of its descendants in the tree.

PSA implementations need not support instantiating these externs at
the top level.  PSA implementations are allowed to accept programs
that use these externs in other places, but they need not.  Thus P4
programmers wishing to maximize the portability of their programs
should restrict their use of these externs to the places indicated in
the table.

`emit` method calls for the type `packet_out` are restricted to be
within deparser control blocks in PSA, because those are the only
places where an instance of type `packet_out` is visible.  Similarly
all methods for type `packet_in`, e.g. `extract` and `advance`, are
restricted to be within parsers in PSA programs.  P4~16~ restricts all
`verify` method calls to be within parsers for all P4~16~ programs,
regardless of whether they are for the PSA.

Rationale:

- It is expected that the highest performance PSA implementations will
  not be able to update the same extern instance from both `Ingress` and
  Egress, nor from more than one of the parsers or controls defined in
  the PSA architecture.
- In a multi-pipeline device, there are effectively multiple
  instantiations of the ingress pipeline and of the egress pipeline.
  The primary motivation to create a multi-pipeline device is the
  practical difficulty in allowing the same stateful object
  (e.g. table, counter, etc.) to be accessed at a packet rate higher
  than that of a single pipeline.  Thus each stateful object should be
  accessed from only a single pipeline on such a device.


## Packet Replication Engine {#sec-pre}

The `PacketReplicationEngine` extern (abbreviated PRE) represents
a part of the PSA pipeline that is not programmable via writing P4
code.

Even though the PRE can not be programmed using P4, it can be
configured both directly using control plane APIs and by setting
intrinsic metadata.  The file `psa.p4` defines some actions
to help set these metadata fields for some common use cases, described
in sections [#sec-ingress-actions] and [#sec-egress-actions].

The PRE extern object has no constructor, and thus it cannot be
instantiated in the user's P4 program. The architecture instantiates
it exactly once, without requiring the user's P4 program to
instantiate it. The PRE is made available to the `PSA_Switch` package.
A corresponding Buffering and Queuing Engine (BQE) extern
is defined for the egress pipeline (see [#sec-bqe]).


## Buffering Queuing Engine {#sec-bqe}

The `BufferingQueueingEngine` extern (abbreviated BQE) represents
another part of the PSA pipeline, after egress, that is not
programmable via writing P4 code.

Even though the BQE can not be programmed using P4, it can be
configured both directly using control plane APIs and by setting
intrinsic metadata.

The BQE extern object has no constructor, and thus it cannot be
instantiated in the user's P4 program. The architecture instantiates
it exactly once, without requiring the user's P4 program to
instantiate it. The BQE is made available to the `PSA_Switch` package.

## Hashes {#sec-hash-algorithms}

Supported hash algorithms:
```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Hash_algorithms]
```

### Hash function

Example usage:

```
parser P() {
  Hash<bit<16>>(HashAlgorithm_t.CRC16) h;
  bit<16> hash_value = h.get_hash(buffer);
}
```

Parameters:

- `algo` -- The algorithm to use for computation (see [#sec-hash-algorithms]).
- `O`       -- The type of the return value of the hash.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Hash_extern]
```

~ TBD
Should there be a `const` defined that specifies the maximum
allowed value of `max` parameter?
~

## Checksums {#sec-checksums}

PSA provides checksum functions compute an integer on the stream of
bytes in packet headers. Checksums are often used as an integrity
check to detect corrupted or otherwise malformed packets.

### Basic checksum {#sec-basic-checksum}

The basic checksum extern provided in PSA supports arbitrary hash
algorithms.

Parameters:

- `W`   -- The width of the checksum

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Checksum_extern]
```

### Incremental checksum {#sec-incremental-checksum}

PSA also provides an incremental checksum that comes equipped with an
additional `subtract` method that can be used to remove data previously
added. The checksum is computed using the `ONES_COMPLEMENT16` hash
algorithm used with protocols such as IPv4, TCP, and UDP -- see [IETF
RFC 1624](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1624)
and section [#appendix-internetchecksum-implementation] for details.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:InternetChecksum_extern]
```

### InternetChecksum examples {#sec-checksum-examples}


The partial program below demonstrates one way to use the `InternetChecksum`
extern to verify whether the checksum field in a parsed IPv4 header is
correct, and set a parser error if it is wrong.  It also demonstrates
checking for parser errors in the `Ingress` control block, dropping
the packet if any errors occurred during parsing.  PSA programs may
choose to handle packets with parser errors in other ways than shown
in this example -- it is up to the P4 program author to choose and
write the desired behavior.

Neither P4~16~ nor the PSA provide any special mechanisms to record
the location within a packet that a parser error occurred. A P4
program author can choose to record such location information
explicitly. For example, one may define metadata fields specifically
for that purpose -- e.g. to hold an encoded value representing the last
parser state reached, or the number of bytes extracted so far -- and then
assign values to those fields within the parser state code.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-parser-checksum.p4:Parse_Error_Example]
```

The partial program below demonstrates one way to use the `InternetChecksum`
extern to calculate and then fill in a correct IPv4 header checksum in
the deparser block.  In this example, the checksum is calculated
fresh, so the outgoing checksum will be correct regardless of what
changes might have been made to the IPv4 header fields in the Ingress
(or Egress) control block that precedes it.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-parser-checksum.p4:Compute_New_IPv4_Checksum_Example]
```

As a final example, we can use the `InternetChecksum` to compute an
incremental checksum for the TCP header. Recall the TCP checksum is
computed over the _entire_ packet, including the payload. Because the
packet payload is not available in P4, we assume that the TCP checksum
on the original packet is correct, and update it incrementally by
invoking `subtract` and then `add` on any fields that are modified by
the program. For example, the `Ingress` control in the program below
updates the IPv4 source address, recording the original source address
in a metadata field:
```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-incremental-checksum.p4:Incremental_Checksum_Table]
```
The deparser first updates the IPv4 checksum as above, and then
incrementally computes the TCP checksum.
```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-incremental-checksum.p4:Incremental_Checksum_Example]
```

## Counters

Counters are a mechanism for keeping statistics.  The control plane
can read counter values.  A P4 program cannot read counter values,
only update them.  If you wish to implement a feature involving
sequence numbers in packets, for example, use Registers instead
(Section [#sec-registers]).

Direct counters are counters associated with a particular P4 table,
and are implemented by the extern `DirectCounter`.  There are also
indexed counters, which are implemented by the extern `Counter`.  The
primary differences between direct counters and indexed counters are:

- Number of independently updatable counter values:
  - A single instantiation of a direct counter always contains as many
    independent counter values as the number of entries in the table
    with which it is associated.
~ TBD
See below for what this means for tables that use action profiles.
~
  - You must specify the number of independent counter values for an
    indexed counter when instantiating it.  This number of counters
    need not be the same as the size of any table.
- Where counter updates are allowed in the P4 program:
  - For a direct counter, you may only invoke its `count` method from
    inside the actions of the table with which it is associated, and
    this always updates the counter value associated with the matching
    table entry.
  - For an indexed counter, you may invoke its `count` method
    anywhere in the P4 program where extern object method invocations
    are permitted (e.g. inside actions, or directly inside a control's
    `apply` block), and every such invocation must specify the index
    of the counter value to be updated.

Counters are only intended to support packet counters and byte
counters, or a combination of both called `PACKETS_AND_BYTES`.  The
byte counts are always increased by some measure of the packet length,
where the packet length used might vary from one PSA implementation to
another.  For example, one implementation might use the Ethernet frame
length, including the Ethernet header and FCS bytes, as the packet
arrived on a physical port.  Another might not include the FCS bytes
in its definition of the packet length.  Another might only include
the Ethernet payload length.  Each PSA implementation should document
how it determines the packet length used for byte counter updates.

If you wish to keep counts of other quantities, or to have more
precise control over the packet length used in a byte counter, you may
use Registers to achieve that (Section [#sec-registers]).


### Counter types

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:CounterType_defn]
```

### Counter

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Counter_extern]
```

See section [#appendix-counter-implementation] for pseudocode of an
example implementation of the Counter extern.

PSA implementations must not update any counter values if an indexed
counter is updated with an index that is too large.  It is recommended
that they count such erroneous attempted updates, and record other
information that can help an P4 programmer debug such errors.


### Direct Counter

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:DirectCounter_extern]
```

A `DirectCounter` instance must appear in the list of values of the
`psa_direct_counters` table attribute for exactly one table.  We call
this table the `DirectCounter` instance's "owner".  It is an error to
call the `count` method for a `DirectCounter` instance anywhere except
inside an action of its owner table.

The counter value updated by an invocation of `count` is always the
one associated with the table entry that matched.

~ TBD
How to describe which counter value is updated for tables with
action profiles and direct counters?  Or should this combination even
be allowed?
~

An action of an owner table need not have `count` method calls for all
of the `DirectCounter` instances that the table owns.  You must use an
explicit `count()` method call on a `DirectCounter` to update it,
otherwise its state will not change.

An example implementation for the `DirectCounter` extern is
essentially the same as the one for `Counter`.  Since there is no
`index` parameter to the `count` method, there is no need to check for
whether it is in range.

The rules here mean that an action that calls `count` on a
`DirectCounter` instance may only be an action of that instance's one
owner table.  If you want to have a single action `A` that can be
invoked by multiple tables, you can still do so by having a unique
action for each such table with a `DirectCounter`, where each such
action in turn calls action `A`, in addition to any `count`
invocations they have.

A `DirectCounter` instance must have a counter value associated with
its owner table that is updated when there is a default action
assigned to the table, and a search of the table results in a miss.
If there is no default action assigned to the table, then there need
not be any counter updated when a search of the table results in a
miss.

By "a default action is assigned to a table", we mean that either the
table has a `default_action` table property with an action assigned to
it in the P4 program, or the control plane has made an explicit call
to assign the table a default action.  If neither of these is true,
then there is no default action assigned to the table.

~ TBD
Verify that the method of reading this default action counter
state is documented for the control plane API.  I believe that Antonin
Bas said that it can be accessed using the same API call used to read
a `DirectCounter` value associated with a table entry, except that the
key in the API call should be empty.
~

~ TBD
Should a single table be restricted to have at most one
DirectCounter associated with it, or should it be allowed to have more
than one?
~

### Example program using counters

The following partial P4 program demonstrates the instantiation and
updating of `Counter` and `DirectCounter` externs.

```

## Meters {#sec-meters}

Meters (RFC 2698) are a more complex mechanism for keeping statistics
about packets, most often used for dropping
or "marking" packets that exceed an average packet or bit rate.  To
mark a packet means to change one or more of its quality of service
values in packet headers such as the 802.1Q PCP (priority code point)
or DSCP (differentiated service code point) bits within the IPv4 or
IPv6 type of service byte.  The meters specified in the PSA are
3-color meters.

PSA meters do not require any particular drop or marking actions, nor
do they automatically implement those behaviors for you.  Meters keep
enough state, and update their state during `execute()` method calls,
in such a way that they return a `GREEN` (also known as conform),
`YELLOW` (exceed), or `RED` (violate) result.  See RFC 2698 for details on the
conditions under which one of these three results is returned.  The P4
program is responsible for examining that returned result, and making
changes to packet forwarding behavior as a result.
The value returned by an uninitialized meter shall be GREEN. This is in
accordance with the P4 Runtime specification.


RFC 2698 describes "color aware" and "color blind" variations of
meters.  The `Meter` and `DirectMeter` externs implement both.  The
only difference is in which `execute` method you use when updating
them.  See the comments on the `extern` definitions below.

Similar to counters, there are two flavors of meters: indexed and
direct.  (Indexed) meters are addressed by index, while direct meters
always update a meter state corresponding to the matched table entry
or action, and from the control plane API are addressed using
P4 Runtime table entry as key.

There are many other similarities between counters and meters,
including:

- The number of independently updatable meter values.
- Where meter updates are allowed in a P4 program.
- For `BYTES` type meters, the packet length used in the update is
  determined by the PSA implementation, and can vary from one PSA
  implementation to another.

Further similarities between direct counters and direct meters
include:

- `DirectMeter` `execute` method calls must be performed within
  actions invoked by the table that owns the `DirectMeter` instance.
  It is optional for such an action to call the `execute` method.
- There must be a meter state associated with a `DirectMeter`
  instance's owner table, that can be updated when the table result is
  a miss.  As for a `DirectCounter`, this state only needs to exist if
  a default action is assigned to the table.

The table attribute to specify that a table owns a `DirectMeter`
instance is `psa_direct_meters`.  The value of this table attribute is
a list of meter instances.

As for counters, if you call the `execute(idx)` method on an indexed
meter and `idx` is at least the number of meter states, so `idx` is
out of range, no meter state is updated.  The `execute` call still
returns a value of type `MeterColor_t`, but the value is undefined --
programs that wish to have predictable behavior across implementations
must not use the undefined value in a way that affects the output
packet or other side effects.  The example code below shows one way to
achieve predictable behavior.  Note that this undefined behavior
cannot occur if the value of `n_meters` of an indexed meter is $2^W$,
and the type `S` used to construct the meter is `bit<W>`, since the
index value could never be out of range.

```
#define METER1_SIZE 100
Meter<bit<7>>(METER1_SIZE, MeterType_t.BYTES) meter1;
bit<7> idx;
MeterColor_t color1;

// ... later ...

if (idx < METER1_SIZE) {
    color1 = meter1.execute(idx, MeterColor_t.GREEN);
} else {
    // If idx is out of range, use a default value for color1.  One
    // may also choose to store an error flag in some metadata field.
    color1 = MeterColor_t.RED;
}
```

Any implementation will have a finite range that can be specified for
the Peak Burst Size and Committed Burst Size.  An implementation
should document the maximum burst sizes they support, and if the
implementation internally truncates the values that the control plane
requests to something more coarse than any number of bytes, that
should also be documented.  It is recommended that the maximum burst
sizes be allowed as large as the number of bytes that can be
transmitted across the implementation's maximum speed port in 100
milliseconds.

Implementations will also have finite ranges and precisions that they
support for the Peak Information Rate and Committed Information Rate.
An implementation should document the maximum rate it supports, as
well as the precision it supports for implementing requested rates.
It is recommended that the maximum rate supported be at least the rate
of the implementation's fastest port, and that the actual implemented
rate should always be within plus or minus 0.1% of the requested rate.

## Registers {#sec-registers}

Registers are stateful memories whose values can be read and written
during packet forwarding under the control of the P4 program.  They
are similar to counters and meters in that their state can be modified
as a result of processing packets, but they are far more general in
the behavior they can implement.

Although you may not use register contents directly in table match
keys, you may use the `read()` method call on the right-hand side of
an assignment statement, which retrieves the current value of the
register.  You may copy the register value into metadata, and it is
then available for matching in subsequent tables.
The value returned by an uninitialized register is undefined. If a target
implementation chooses to return some value, the PSA recommends the
value should be 0.

A simple usage example might be to verify that a "first packet" was
seen for a particular type of flow.  A register cell would be
allocated to the flow, initialized to "clear".  When the protocol
signaled a "first packet", the table would match on this value and
update the flow's cell to "marked".  Subsequent packets in the flow
could would be mapped to the same cell; the current cell value would
be stored in metadata for the packet and a subsequent table could
check that the flow was marked as active.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Register_extern]
```

Another example using registers is given below.  It implements a
packet and byte counter, where the byte counter can be updated by a
packet length specified in the P4 program, rather than one chosen by
the PSA implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-register2.p4:Register_Example2_Part1]

[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-register2.p4:Register_Example2_Part2]
```

Note the use of the `@atomic` annotation in the block enclosing the
`read()` and `write()` method calls on the `Register` instance.  It is
expected to be common that register accesses will need the `@atomic`
annotation around portions of your program in order to behave as you
desire.  As stated in the P4~16~ specification, without the `@atomic`
annotation in this example, an implementation is allowed to process
two packets `P1` and `P2` in parallel, and perform the register access
operations in this order:

```
    // Possible order of operations for the example program if the
    // @atomic annotation is _not_ used.

    tmp = port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.read(istd.ingress_port);  // for packet P1
    tmp = port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.read(istd.ingress_port);  // for packet P2

    // At this time, if P1 and P2 came from the same ingress_port,
    // each of their values of tmp are identical.

    update_pkt_ip_byte_count(tmp, hdr.ipv4.totalLen);    // for packet P1
    update_pkt_ip_byte_count(tmp, hdr.ipv4.totalLen);    // for packet P2

    port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.write(istd.ingress_port, tmp);  // for packet P1
    port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.write(istd.ingress_port, tmp);  // for packet P2
    // The write() from packet P1 is lost.
```

Since different implementations may have different upper limits on the
complexity of code that they will accept within an `@atomic` block, we
recommend you keep them as small as possible, subject to maintaining
your desired correct behavior.

Individual counter and meter method calls need not be enclosed in
`@atomic` blocks to be safe -- they guarantee atomic behavior of their
individual method calls, without losing any updates.

As for indexed counters and meters, access to an index of a register
that is at least the size of the register is out of bounds.  An out of
bounds write has no effect on the state of the system.  An out of
bounds read returns an undefined value.  See the example in Section
[#sec-meters] for one way to write code to guarantee avoiding this
undefined behavior.  Out of bounds register accesses are impossible
for a register instance with type `S` declared as `bit<W>` and size
$2^W$ entries.


## Random

The `Random` extern provides generation of pseudo-random numbers in a
specified range with a uniform distribution.  If one wishes to
generate numbers with a non-uniform distribution, you may do so by
first generating a uniformly distributed random value, and then using
appropriate table lookups and/or arithmetic on the resulting value to
achieve the desired distribution.

An implementation is not required to produce cryptographically strong
pseudo-random number generation.  For example, a particularly
inexpensive implementation might use a linear feedback shift register
to generate values.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Random_extern]
```


## Action Profile

Action profiles are used as table implementation attributes.

Action profiles provide a mechanism to populate table entries
with action specifications that have been defined outside the table entry
specification. An action profile extern can be instantiated as
a resource in the P4 program. A table that uses this action profile
must specify its implementation attribute as the action profile
instance.

~ Figure {#fig-ap; caption: "Action profiles in PSA"; page-align: here;}
![ap]
~
[ap]: figs/action_profile.png { width: 75%;}

Figure [#fig-ap] contrasts a direct table with a table that has an action
profile implementation. A direct table, as seen in Figure [#fig-ap] (a) contains
the action specification in each table entry. In this example, the table has a
match key consisting of an LPM on header field `h.f`. The action is to set the
port. As we can see, entries t1 and t3 have the same action, i.e. to set the
port to 1. Action profiles enable sharing an action across multiple entries by
using a separate table as shown in Figure [#fig-ap] (b).

A table with an action profile implementation has entries that point to a member
reference instead of directly defining an action specification. A mapping from
member references to action specifications is maintained in a separate table
that is part of the action profile instance defined in the table implementation
attribute. When a table with an action profile implementation is applied, the
member reference is resolved and the corresponding action specification is
applied to the packet.

Action profile members may only specify action types defined in the `actions`
attribute of the implemented table. An action profile instance may be shared
across multiple tables only if all such tables define the same set of actions
in their `actions` attribute. Tables with an action profile implementation
cannot define a default action. The default action for such tables is implicitly
set to `NoAction`.

The control plane can add, modify or delete member entries for a
given action profile instance. The controller-assigned member reference
must be unique in the scope of the action profile instance. An
action profile instance may hold at most `size` entries as defined in the
constructor parameter. Table entries must specify the action using the
controller-assigned reference for the desired member entry. Directly specifying
the action as part of the table entry is not allowed for tables with an
action profile implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:ActionProfile_extern]
```

### Action Profile Example
The P4 control block `Ctrl` in the example below instantiates an
action profile `ap` that can contain at most 128 member entries. Table
`indirect` uses this instance by specifying the implementation attribute.
The control plane can add member entries to `ap`, where each member can
specify either a `foo` or `NoAction` action. Table entries for `indirect`
table must specify the action using the controller-assigned member reference.

```
control Ctrl(inout H hdr, inout M meta) {

  action foo() { meta.foo = 1; }

  action_profile ap(32w128);

  table indirect {
    key = {hdr.ipv4.dst_address: exact;}
    actions = { foo; NoAction; }
    implementation = ap;
  }

  apply {
    indirect.apply();
  }
}
```


## Action Selector

Action selectors are used as table implementation attributes.

Action selectors implement yet another mechanism to populate table
entries with action specifications that have been defined outside the
table entry. They are more powerful than action profiles because they also
provide the ability to dynamically select the action specification to apply
upon matching a table entry. An action selector extern can be instantiated as
a resource in the P4 program, similar to action profiles. Furthermore,
a table that uses this action selector must specify its implementation attribute
as the action selector instance.

~ Figure {#fig-as; caption: "Action selectors in PSA"; page-align: here;}
![as]
~
[as]: figs/action_selector.png { width: 90%;}

Figure [#fig-as] illustrates a table that has an action selector implementation.
In this example, the table has a match key consisting of an LPM on header field
`h.f`. A second match type `selector` is used to define the fields that are
used to look up the action specification from the selector at runtime.

A table with an action action selector implementation consists of entries that
point to either an action profile member reference or an action profile group
reference. An action selector instance can be logically visualized as two tables
as shown in Figure [#fig-as]. The first table contains a mapping from group
references to a set of member references. The second table contains a mapping
from member references to action specifications.

When a packet matches a table entry at runtime, the controller-assigned
reference of the action profile member or group is read. If the entry points to
a member then the corresponding action specification is applied to the packet.
However, if the entry points to a group, a dynamic selection algorithm is used
to select a member from the group, and the action specification
corresponding to that member is applied. The dynamic selection algorithm is
specified as a parameter when instantiating the action selector.

Action selector members may only specify action types defined
in the `actions` attribute of the implemented table. All actions in a group must be
of the same type. The action parameters for actions in the same group are allowed
to differ, and the action of different groups in a selector may be different.
An action selector instance may be shared across multiple tables only if all such
tables define the same set of actions in their `actions` attribute. Furthermore,
the selector match fields for such tables must be identical and must be specified
in the same order across all tables sharing the selector. Tables with an action
selector implementation cannot define a default action. The default action for
such tables is implicitly set to `NoAction`.

The dynamic selection algorithm requires a field list as an input for generating
the index to a member entry in a group. This field list is created by using the
match type `selector` when defining the table match key. The match fields of
type `selector` are composed into a field list in the order they are specified.
The composed field list is passed as an input to the action selector
implementation. It is illegal to define a `selector` type match field if the
table does not have an action selector implementation.

The control plane can add, modify or delete member and group entries for a
given action selector instance. An action selector instance may hold at most
`size` member entries as defined in the constructor parameter. The number of
groups may be at most the size of the table that is implemented by the selector.
Table entries must specify the action using a reference to the desired member
or group entry. Directly specifying the action as part of the table entry is not
allowed for tables with an action selector implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:ActionSelector_extern]
```
### Action Selector Example
The P4 control block `Ctrl` in the example below instantiates an
action selector `as` that can contain at most 128 member entries. The
action selector uses a crc16 algorithm with output width of 10 bits
to select a member entry within a group.

Table `indirect_with_selection` uses this instance by specifying the
implementation attribute as shown. The control plane can add member and group
entries to `as`. Each member can specify either a `foo` or `NoAction` action.
When programming the table entries, the control plane *does not* include the
fields of match type `selector` in the match key. The selector match fields are
instead used to compose a list that is passed to the action selector instance.
In the example below, the list {hdr.ipv4.src_address, hdr.ipv4.protocol} is
passed as input to the crc16 hash algorithm used for dynamic member selection
by action selector `as`.

```
control Ctrl(inout H hdr, inout M meta) {

  action foo() { meta.foo = 1; }

  action_selector as(HashAlgorithm.crc16, 32w128, 32w10);

  table indirect_with_selection {
    key = {
      hdr.ipv4.dst_address: exact;
      hdr.ipv4.src_address: selector;
      hdr.ipv4.protocol: selector;
    }
    actions = { foo; NoAction; }
    implementation = as;
  }

  apply {
    indirect_with_selection.apply();
  }
}
```


## Parser Value Sets

A parser value set is a named set of values that may be used during
packet header parsing time to make decisions.  You may use control
plane API calls to add values to a set, and remove values from a set,
at run time, much like P4 tables.  Unlike tables, they may not have
actions associated with them.  They may only be used to determine
whether a particular value is in the set, returning a Boolean value.
That Boolean value can then be used in a `select` statement to control
parsing (see examples below).

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:ValueSet_extern]
```

The control plane API excerpt above is intended to be added as part of
the P4 Runtime API[^P4RuntimeAPI].

[^P4RuntimeAPI]: The P4 Runtime API, defined as a Google Protocol
    Buffer `.proto` file, can be found at
    <https://github.com/p4lang/PI/blob/master/proto/p4/p4runtime.proto>

The control plane API for a `ValueSet` is similar to that of a table,
except only match fields may be specified, with no actions.  This
includes API calls that specify ternary or range matching, although
for `ValueSet`s these do not require specifying any priority values,
since the only result of a `ValueSet` `is_member` call is "in the set"
or "not in the set".

If a PSA target can do so, it should implement control plane API calls
involving ternary or range matching using ternary or range matching
capabilities in the target, consuming the minimal table entries
possible.

However, a PSA target is allowed to implement such control plane API
calls by "expanding" them into as many exact match entries as needed
to have the same behavior.  For example, a control plane API call
adding all values in the range 5 through 8 may be implemented as
adding the four separate exact match values 5, 6, 7, and 8.

The parser definition below shows an example that uses two `ValueSet`
instances called `tpid_types` and `trill_types`.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-value-sets.p4:ValueSet_Example_1]
```

The second example (below) has the same parsing behavior as the
example above, but combines the two parse states
`dispatch_tpid_value_set` and `dispatch_trill_value_set` into one.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-value-sets2.p4:ValueSet_Example_2]
```

The third example (below) demonstrates one way to have a `ValueSet`
that matches on multiple fields, by making the type `D` a `struct`
containing multiple bit vectors.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-value-sets3.p4:ValueSet_Example_3]
```

A PSA compliant implementation is not required to support any use of a
`ValueSet` `is_member` method call return value, other than directly
inside of a `select` expression.  For example, a program fragment like
the one shown below may be rejected, and thus P4 programmers striving
for maximum portability should avoid writing such code.
```
    bool is_tpid = tpid_types.is_member(parsed_hdr.ethernet.etherType);

    is_tpid = is_tpid && (parsed_hdr.ethernet.dstAddr[47:40] == 0xfe);
    transition select(is_tpid) {
        // ...
```


## Timestamps

A PSA implementation provides an `ingress_timestamp` value for every
packet in the `Ingress` control block, as a field in the struct with
type `psa_ingress_input_metadata_t`.  This timestamp should be close
to the time that the first bit of the packet arrived to the device, or
alternately, to the time that the device began parsing the packet.
This timestamp is _not_ automatically included with the packet in the
`Egress` control block.  A P4 program wishing to use the value of
`ingress_timestamp` in egress code must copy it to a user-defined
metadata field that reaches egress.

A PSA implementation also provides an `egress_timestamp` value for
every packet in the `Egress` control block, as a field of the struct
with type `psa_egress_input_metadata_t`.

One expected use case for timestamps is to store them in tables or
`Register` instances to implement checking for timeout events for
protocols, where precision on the order of milliseconds is sufficient
for most protocols.

Another expected use case is INT (In-band Network Telemetry[^INT]),
where precision on the order of microseconds or smaller is necessary
to measure queueing latencies that differ by those amounts.  It takes
only 0.74 microseconds to transmit a 9 Kbyte Ethernet jumbo frame on a
100 gigabit per second link.

[^INT]: <http://p4.org/p4/inband-network-telemetry>

For these applications, it is recommended that an implementation's
timestamp increments at least once every microsecond.  Incrementing
once per clock cycle in an ASIC or FPGA implementation would be a
reasonable choice.  The timestamp should increment at a constant rate
over time.  For example, it should not be a simple count of clock
cycles in a device that implements dynamic frequency
scaling[^DynamicFrequencyScaling].

[^DynamicFrequencyScaling]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling>

Timestamps are of type `Timestamp_t`, which is type `bit<W>` for a
value of `W` defined by the implementation.  Timestamps are expected
to wrap around during the normal passage of time.  It is recommended
that an implementation pick a rate of advance and a bit width such
that wrapping around occurs at most once every hour.  Making the wrap
time this long (or longer) makes timestamps more useful for several
use cases.

- Checking for timeouts of protocol hello / keep-alive traffic that is
  on the order of seconds or minutes.
- If timestamps are placed into packets without converting them to
  other formats, then external data analysis systems using those
  timestamps will in many cases need to do so, e.g. to compare
  timestamps stored in packets by different PSA devices.  These
  systems will need different formulas and/or parameters to perform
  this conversion for each wrap period, or to add extra external time
  references to the recorded data.  The extra data required for
  accurate conversion is lower, and the likelihood of conversion
  mistakes is lower, if the timestamp values wrap less often.
- If timestamps are converted to other formats within a P4 program, it
  will need access to parameters that are likely to change every wrap
  time, e.g. at least a "base value" to add some calculated value to.
  A straightforward way to do this requires the control plane to
  update these values at least once or twice per timestamp wrap time.
- Programs that wish to use `(egress_timestamp - ingress_timestamp)`
  to calculate the queueing latency experienced by a packet need the
  wrap time to exceed the maximum queueing latency.

Examples of the number of bits required for wrap times of at least one
hour:

- A 32-bit timestamp advancing by 1 per microsecond takes 1.19 hours
  to wrap.
- A 42-bit timestamp advancing by 1 per nanosecond takes 1.22 hours to
  wrap.

A PSA implementation is not required to implement time
synchronization, e.g. via PTP[^PTP] or NTP[^NTP].

[^PTP]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol>
[^NTP]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>

~ TBD
 This text has been written assuming that it is more important for
timestamps to be increasing at a constant rate, with no sudden "jumps"
due to time synchronization events.  Is this what people want from
timestamps?
~

~ TBD
 Some time synchronization methods avoid sudden "jumps" by
temporarily speeding up or slowing down the rate of increase by a
small percentage, until the desired synchronization is achieved.
Which ones?  citation?).  Would anyone mind if PSA
implementations were allowed to do this with their timestamp values?

```

For every packet `P` that is processed by ingress and then egress,
with the minimum possible latency in the packet buffer, it is
guaranteed that the `egress_timestamp` value for that packet will be
the same as, or slightly larger than, the `ingress_timestamp` value
that the packet was assigned on ingress.  By "slightly larger than",
we mean that the difference `(egress_timestamp - ingress_timestamp)`
should be a reasonably accurate estimate of this minimum possible
latency through the packet buffer, perhaps truncated down to 0 if
timestamps advance more slowly than this minimum latency.

Consider two packets such that at the same time (e.g. the same clock
cycle), one is assigned its value of `ingress_timestamp` near the time
it begins parsing, and the other is assigned its value of
`egress_timestamp` near the time that it begins its egress processing.
It is allowed that these timestamps differ by a few tens of
nanoseconds (or by one "tick" of the timestamp, if one tick is larger
than that time), due to practical difficulties in making them always
equal.

Recall that the binary operators `+` and `-` on the `bit<W>` type in
P4 are defined to perform wrap-around unsigned arithmetic.  Thus even
if a timestamp value wraps around from its maximum value back to 0,
you can always calculate the number of ticks that have elapsed from
timestamp $t1$ until timestamp $t2$ using the expression $(t2 - t1)$
(if more than $2^W$ ticks have elapsed, there will be aliasing of the
result).  For example, if timestamps were $W >= 4$ bits in size,
$t1=2^{W}-5$, and $t2=3$, then $(t2-t1)=8$.

It is sometimes useful to minimize storage costs by discarding some
bits of a timestamp value in a P4 program for use cases that do not
need the full wrap time or precision.  For example, an application
that only needs to detect protocol timeouts with an accuracy of 1
second can discard the least significant bits of a timestamp that
change more often than every 1 second.

Another example is an application that needed full precision of the
least significant bits of a timestamp, but the combination of the
control plane and P4 program are designed to examine all entries of a
`Register` array where these partial timestamps are stored more often
than once every 5 seconds, to prevent wrapping.  In that case, the P4
program could discard the most significant bits of the timestamp so
that the remaining bits wrap every 8 seconds, and store those partial
timestamps in the `Register` instance.

### Packet Digest

Packet digest is a mechanism to perform a upcall to the control plane.
A upcall is a way to send information from the lower layer of the
software stack to an upper layer. In the case of packet digest, the
information is sent from data-plane to control plane.

A PSA implementation should provide a digest mechanism. The digest
contains two pieces of information: the receiver identifier and the
digest message. The receiver identifier is an opaque id used by the
control plane to route the digest message to the right receiver. The
digest message can contain any from the data-plane.

In PSA, digest is performed at the end of the ingress pipeline in the
deparser.
~ TBD
The digest extern provides a `pack` method to specify the
content in the digest header.
~

The compiler decides the best serialization format to send the data
object to the control plane.

On the control plane side, the control plane API calls the `unpack`
method, and pass in a reference to the data object to be read.

The `unpack` method return 0 if succeed. The field names in the
control plane API is derived from the field names in the data-plane
`pack` method.

#### Control Plane

The control plane should provide a

# Appendix: Open Issues {@h1:"A"}

As with any work in progress, we have a number of open issues that are under discussion in the
working group. In addition to the TBDs in the document, there a number of larger issues that are
summarized here:

## Action Selectors

The size parameter in the action_selector instance that defines the maximum number of members in a
selector. In some cases it might be useful to allow the controller to dynamically provision
resources on the selector or to utilize different selector sizes on different targets, while using
a common P4 program.

We also need to formalize the interaction of action profiles and action selectors with counters and
meters.

## Metadata serialization {#sec-open-metadata}

We have several proposals for serializing metadata that is bridged across the PRE between the
ingress and egress pipelines, or as part of cloned and resubmitted packets. We are actively working
on building a set of examples to determine what will be the final PSA API for these operations.

For the `clone_out` and `resubmit` externs, we are currently discussing the addition of a method,
`add_metadata`, to enable prepending metadata to the cloned or resubmitted packet. It is
the responsibility of the programmer to parse these packets such that it correctly extracts the
attached metadata. The attached metadata may be of type `header`, `header stack`, `header union` or
`struct` of the above types. Invoking the `add_metadata` method multiple times will attach all
specified metadata to the same copy of the packet in the order in which the method was called. The
PSA architecture instantiates the `clone_out` extern in the ingress and egress deparser. It is an
error to instantiate the `clone_out` extern in blocks other than the deparser block.


## How does PSA interact with multiple pipelines

As presented, the PSA describes the operation of a single packet processing pipeline. However,
programmable devices typically support multiple pipelines. It is unlikely that high performance
devices implement any form of coherency across pipelines, even though forwarding across pipelines
may happen.

In the current specification, each extern has its own resources and they are constrained to a
single pipeline, i.e., not shared across pipelines and not maintained coherent with any other
externs even if attached to the same logical table. It is the responsibility of the programmer to
maintain state across pipelines using control-plane operations, if so desired.

Likewise, for programming multiple pipelines, it is the responsibility of the vendor and of target
dependent tools to specify how PSA programs are mapped to multiple pipelines. A simple
implementation may use a copy of the PSA program on each pipeline, and thus keeping pipelines fully
isolated. We will continue to discuss and refine our position.

## PSA profiles

We are considering whether to specify different limits that a certain PSA implementation has to have in order for the implementation to be considered compliant. The main point of PSA is to enable a variety of devices, and thus limits may be artificial. On the other hand, for most interesting applications, it is necessary to support a minimum of functionality.

# Appendix: Implementation of the InternetChecksum extern {#appendix-internetchecksum-implementation}

Besides RFC 1461, RFC 1071 and RFC 1141 also contain useful tips on
efficiently computing the Internet checksum, especially in software
implementations.

Here we give reference implementations for the methods of the
`InternetChecksum` extern, specified with the syntax and semantics of
P4~16~, with extensions of a `for` loop and a `return` statement for
returning a value from a function.

The minimum internal state necessary for one instance of an
`InternetChecksum` object is a 16-bit bit vector, here called `sum`.

```
// This is one way to perform a normal one's complement sum of two
// 16-bit values.
bit<16> ones_complement_sum(in bit<16> x, in bit<16> y) {
    bit<17> ret = (bit<17>) x + (bit<17>) y;
    if (ret[16:16] == 1) {
        ret = ret + 1;
    }
    return ret[15:0];
}

bit<16> sum;

void clear() {
    sum = 0;
}

// Restriction: data is a multiple of 16 bits long
void update<T>(in T data) {
    bit<16> d;
    for (each 16-bit aligned piece d of data) {
        sum = ones_complement_sum(sum, d);
    }
}

// Restriction: data is a multiple of 16 bits long
void remove<T>(in T data) {
    bit<16> d;
    for (each 16-bit aligned piece d of data) {
        // ~d is the negative of d in one's complement arithmetic.
        sum = ones_complement_sum(sum, ~d);
    }
}

// The Internet checksum is the one's complement _of_ the one's
// complement sum of the relevant parts of the packet.  The methods
// above calculate the one's complement sum of the parts in the
// variable 'sum'.  get() returns the bitwise negation of 'sum', which
// is the one's complement of 'sum'.

bit<16> get() {
    return ~sum;
}

bit<16> get_state() {
    return sum;
}

void set_state(bit<16> checksum_state) {
    sum = checksum_state;
}
```


# Appendix: Example implementation of Counter extern {#appendix-counter-implementation}

The example implementation below, in particular the function
`next_counter_value`, is not intended to restrict PSA implementations.
The storage format for `PACKETS_AND_BYTES` type counters demonstrated
there is one example of how it could be done.  Implementations are
free to store state in other ways, as long as the control plane API
returns the correct packet and byte count values.

Two common techniques for counter implementations in the data plane are:

- wrap around counters
- saturating counters, that 'stick' at their maximum possible value,
  without wrapping around.

This specification does not mandate any particular approach in the
data plane.  Implementations should strive to avoid losing information
in counters.  One common implementation technique is to implement an
atomic "read and clear" operation in the data plane that can be
invoked by the control plane software.  The control plane software
invokes this operation frequently enough to prevent counters from ever
wrapping or saturating, and adds the values read to larger counters in
driver memory.

```
Counter(bit<32> n_counters, CounterType_t type) {
    this.num_counters = n_counters;
    this.counter_vals = new array of size n_counters, each element with type W;
    this.type = type;
    if (this.type == CounterType_t.PACKETS_AND_BYTES) {
        // Packet and byte counts share storage in the same counter
        // state.  Should we have a separate constructor with an
        // additional argument indicating how many of the bits to use
        // for the byte counter?
        W shift_amount = TBD;
        this.shifted_packet_count = ((W) 1) << shift_amount;
        this.packet_count_mask = (~((W) 0)) << shift_amount;
        this.byte_count_mask = ~this.packet_count_mask;
    }
}

W next_counter_value(W cur_value, CounterType_t type) {
    if (type == CounterType_t.PACKETS) {
        return (cur_value + 1);
    }
    // Exactly which packet bytes are included in packet_len is
    // implementation-specific.
    PacketLength_t packet_len = <packet length in bytes>;
    if (type == CounterType_t.BYTES) {
        return (cur_value + packet_len);
    }
    // type must be CounterType_t.PACKETS_AND_BYTES
    // In type W, the least significant bits contain the byte
    // count, and most significant bits contain the packet count.
    // This is merely one example storage format.  Implementations
    // are free to store packets_and_byte state in other ways, as
    // long as the control plane API returns the correct separate
    // packet and byte count values.
    W next_packet_count = ((cur_value + this.shifted_packet_count) &
                           this.packet_count_mask);
    W next_byte_count = (cur_value + packet_len) & this.byte_count_mask;
    return (next_packet_count | next_byte_count);
}

void count(in S index) {
    if (index < this.num_counters) {
        this.counter_vals[index] = next_counter_value(this.counter_vals[index],
                                                      this.type);
    } else {
        // No counter_vals updated if index is out of range.
        // See below for optional debug information to record.
    }
}
```

Optional debugging information that may be kept if an `index` value is
out of range includes:

- Number of times this occurs.
- A FIFO of the first N out-of-range index values that occur, where N
  is implementation-defined (e.g. it might only be 1).  Extra
  information to identify which `count()` method call in the P4
  program had the out-of-range `index` value is also recommended.
