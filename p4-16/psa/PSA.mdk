~ Begin Abstract

P4 is a language for expressing how packets are processed by the data
plane of a programmable network forwarding element. P4 programs
specify how the various programmable blocks of a target architecture
are programmed and connected.  The Portable Switch Architecture (PSA)
is a target architecture that describes common capabilities of network
switch devices that process and forward packets across multiple
interface ports.

# Target Architecture Model


As an analogy, the PSA is to the P4~16~ language as the C standard
library is to the C programming language.  PSA defines a library of
types, P4~16~ externs for frequently used constructs such as counters,
meters, and registers, and a set of "packet paths" that enable you to
write P4 programs that control the flow of packets in a packet switch
that has multiple ports, e.g. dozens of Ethernet ports.  By following
the APIs and guidelines here, developers will be able to write P4
programs that are portable across many devices that are conformant to
the PSA.

While parts of PSA are specific to network switches, and a "Portable
NIC Architecture" (if such a thing is developed) would differ
significantly from PSA in those parts, we expect the externs defined
here will be of general use across multiple P4~16~ architectures.

The Portable Switch Architecture (PSA) Model has six programmable P4
blocks and two fixed-function blocks, as shown in Figure
[#fig-switch]. The behavior of the programmable blocks is specified
using P4.  The Packet buffer and Replication Engine (PRE) and the
Buffer Queuing Engine (BQE) are target dependent functional blocks
that may be configured for a fixed set of operations.

Incoming packets are parsed and validated, and then passed to an
ingress match action pipeline, which makes decisions on where the
packets go.  The ingress deparser P4 code specifies the packet
contents to be sent to the packet buffer, and what metadata related to
the packet is carried with it.  After the ingress pipeline, the packet
may optionally be replicated (i.e. copies made to multiple egress
ports), then stored in the packet buffer.

For each such egress port, the packet passes through an egress parser
and match action pipeline before it is deparsed and queued to leave
the pipeline.

A programmer targeting the PSA is required to define objects in P4 for
the programmable blocks that conform to APIs defined later (see
section [#sec-programmable-blocks]).  The programmable block inputs
and outputs are templatized on user defined headers and metadata.
Once these six blocks are defined, a P4 program for PSA instantiates
the `main` `package` object, with the programmable blocks passed as
arguments (see Section [#sec-pre] for an example).

A P4 programmer wishing to maximize the portability of their program
should follow several general guidelines:

- Do not use undefined values in a way that affects the resulting
  output packet(s), or for side effects such as updating `Counter`,
  `Meter` or `Register` instances.
- Use as few resources as possible, e.g. table search key bits, array
  sizes, quantity of metadata associated with packets, etc.

This document contains excerpts of several P4~16~ programs that use
the `psa.p4` include file and demonstrate features of PSA.  Source
code for the complete programs can be found in the official repository
containing the PSA specification[^PSAExamplePrograms].

# Naming conventions

In this document we use the following naming conventions:

- Types are named using CamelCase followed by `_t`. For example, `PortId_t`.
- Control types and extern object types are named using CamelCase. For
example `IngressParser`.
- Struct types are named using lower case words separated by `_`
  followed by `_t`. For example `psa_ingress_input_metadata_t`.
- Actions, extern methods, extern functions, headers, structs, and
  instances of controls and externs start with lower case and words
  are separated using `_`. For example `send_to_port`.
- Enum members, const definitions, and #define constants are all
  caps, with words separated by `_`. For example `PSA_PORT_CPU`.

Architecture specific metadata (e.g. structs) are prefixed by `psa_`.


# Packet paths {#packet-paths}

Figure [#fig-packet-paths] shows all possible paths for packets that
must be supported by a PSA implementation.  An implementation is
allowed to support paths for packets that are not described here.

Table [#packet-path-abbreviations] defines the meanings of the
abbreviations in Figure [#fig-packet-paths].  There can be one or more
hardware, software, or PSA architecture components between the "packet
source" and "packet destination" given in that table, e.g. a normal
multicast packet passes through the packet replication engine and
typically also a packet buffer after leaving the ingress deparser,
before arriving at the egress parser.  This table focuses on the
P4-programmable portions of the architecture as sources and
destinations of these packet paths.

happen to a packet as a result of a single time being processed in
ingress, or a single time being processed in egress.  The cases are

There are metadata fields defined by PSA that enable your P4 program
to identify which path each packet arrived on, and to control where it
will go next.  See section [#packet-path-details].

For egress packets, the choice between one of multiple egress ports,
the port to the CPU, or the "recirculation port", is made by the
immediately previous processing step (ingress for NU, NM, or CI2E
packets, egress for CE2E packets).  Egress processing can choose to
drop the packet instead of sending it to the port chosen earlier, but
it cannot change the choice to a different port.  Ingress code is the
most common place in a P4 program where the output port(s) are chosen.
The only exception to ingress choosing the output port is for
egress-to-egress clone packets, whose destination port is chosen when
the clone is created in the immediately preceding egress processing
step.  See section
[#appendix-rationale-egress-cannot-change-output-port] for why this
restriction exists.

A single packet received by a PSA system from a port can result in 0,
1, or many packets going out, all under control of the P4 program.
For example, a single packet received from a port could cause all of
the following to occur, if the P4 program so directed it:

+ The original packet received as NFP from port 2.  Ingress processing
  creates a CI2E clone destined for the CPU port (copy 1), and a
  multicast NM packet to multicast group 18, which is configured in
  the PacketReplicationEngine to have copies made to ports 5 (copy 2)
  and the recirculate port `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE` (copy 3).
+ Copy 1 performs egress processing, which sends the packet on path
  NTCPU to the CPU port.
+ Copy 2 performs egress processing, which creates a CE2E clone
  destined for port 8 (copy 4), and sends a NTP packet to port 5.
+ Copy 3 performs egress processing, which does a RECIRC back to
  ingress (copy 5).
+ Copy 4 performs egress processing, which sends a NTP packet to port
  8.
+ Copy 5 performs ingress processing, which sends a NU packet destined
  for port 1 (copy 6).
+ Copy 6 performs egress processing, which drops the packet instead of
  sending it to port 1.

This is simply an example of what is possible given an appropriately
written P4 program.  There is no need to use all of the packet paths
available.  The numbering of the packet copies above is only for
purposes of distinctly identifying each one in the example.  The ports
described in the example are also arbitrary. A PSA
implementation is free to perform the steps above in many possible
orders.

There is no mandated mechanism in PSA to prevent a single received
packet from creating packets that continue to recirculate, resubmit,
or clone from egress to egress indefinitely.  This can be prevented by
suitable testing of your P4 program, and/or creating in your P4
program a "time to live" metadata field that is carried along with
copies of a packet, similar to the IPv4 Time To Live header field.

A PSA implementation may optionally drop resubmitted, recirculated, or
egress-to-egress clone packets after an implementation-specific
maximum number of times from the same original packet.  If so, the
implementation should maintain counters of packets dropped for these
reasons, and preferably record some debug information about the first
few packets dropped for these reasons (perhaps only one).


# PSA Data types

## PSA type definitions {#sec-psa-type-definitions}

Each PSA implementation will have specific bit widths for the
following types in the data plane.  These widths are defined in the
target specific `psa.p4` include file.  They are expected to differ
from one PSA implementation to another[^PSAP4TargetSpecific].

[^PSAP4TargetSpecific]: It is expected that `psa.p4` include files for
    different targets will typically be nearly identical to each
    other.  Besides the possibility of differing bit widths for these
    PSA types, the only expected differences between `psa.p4` files
    for different targets would be annotations on externs, etc. that
    the P4 compiler for that target needs to do its job.

For each of these types, the P4 Runtime API[^P4RuntimeAPI] may use bit
widths independent of the targets.  These widths are defined by the P4
Runtime API specification, and they are expected to be at least as
large as the corresponding `InHeader_t` type below, such that they
hold a value for any target.  All PSA implementations must use data
plane sizes for these types no wider than the corresponding
`InHeader_t`-defined types.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Type_defns]
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Type_defns2]
```

## PSA supported metadata types

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_types]
```

## Match kinds

PSA supports the following additional `match_kind` types, over and
above the three defined in the P4~16~ language specification:

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Match_kinds]
```

`selector` is only supported for tables with an action selector implementation.
See Section [#sec-action-selector] for details.


### Range tables

If a table has at least one `range` field, then a single search key could match
multiple table entries. Every entry must be assigned a numeric priority by the
control plane software when it is installed. If multiple installed table entries
match the same search key, one among them with the maximum numeric priority will
"win", and its action performed. If there are multiple matching table entries
with the same maximum numeric priority, it is implementation-specific which one
will have its action performed. Control plane software should assign different
priority values to table entries that can match the same packet if they wish to
avoid this implementation-specific behavior.

The winner is one with maximum numeric priority value if you use the P4Runtime
API to specify the numeric priorities. Check the documentation of your control
plane API if you use a different one, as some APIs might choose to use the
convention that smaller numeric priority values win over larger ones.

A range table may have one or more `lpm` fields. If so, the prefix length is
used to determine whether a search key matches the entry, but the prefix length
does _not_ determine the relative priority among multiple matching table
entries. Only the numeric priority supplied by the control plane software
determines that.

If a range table has entries defined via a `const entries` table property, then
the relative priority of the entries are highest priority first, to lowest
priority last, based upon the order they appear in the P4 program.


### Ternary tables

If a table has no `range` field, but at least one `ternary` or `optional` field,
then as for tables with `range` fields, a single search key can be matched by
multiple table entries, and thus every entry must have a numeric priority
assigned by the control plane software. The same note about `lpm` fields in the
previous section applies here, as well as the note about entries specified via
`const entries`.


### Longest prefix match tables

If a table has no `range`, `ternary`, nor `optional` fields, but at least one
`lpm` field, there must be exactly one `lpm` field. There may be 0 or more
`exact` fields in addition to the `lpm` field. While there can be multiple
installed table entries that match a single search key, there can be at most one
matching table entry of each possible prefix length of the `lpm` field (because
no two table entries installed at the same time are allowed to have the same
search key). The matching entry with the longest prefix length is always the
winner. The control plane cannot specify a priority when installing entries for
such a table -- it is always determined by the prefix length.

If a longest prefix match table has entries defined via a `const entries` table
property, then the relative priority of the entries are determined by the prefix
lengths, not by the order they appear in the P4 program.


### Exact match tables

If a table has only `exact` fields, then for any search key, there can be at
most one matching table entry, because duplicate search keys are not allowed to
be installed. Thus no numeric priority is ever needed to determine the "winning"
matching table entry.

If an exact match table has entries defined via a `const entries` table
property, there can be at most one matching entry for any search key, so the
relative order that entries appear in the P4 program is unimportant in
determining which entry will win.


## Data plane vs. control plane data representations {#sec-data-plane-vs-control-plane-values}

A PSA data plane implementation that supports the P4 Runtime
API[^P4RuntimeAPI] includes software called a "P4 Runtime Server" that
enables runtime programming of the PSA device from one or more "P4
Runtime Clients".  For brevity, here we will call a P4 Runtime Server
an "agent", and a P4 Runtime Client a "controller".  A controller may
control multiple devices with different PSA implementations.

As mentioned in section [#sec-psa-type-definitions], different PSA
implementations are expected to customize the size of the data types
that refer directly to those objects in the data plane, i.e. ports,
multicast group ids, etc.

Some PSA implementations are expected to use noticeably fewer
resources for things like table keys and action parameters if the data
plane stores only the fewest number of bits required for values of
these types, for that implementation.  For example, an implementation
that defines `PortId_t` as `bit<6>` instead of `bit<16>`, and can take
advantage of this difference, could save 10 Mbits of storage in a
table with a million entries[^CacheCost].

[^CacheCost]: While 10 Mbits sounds tiny to one accustomed to computers with hundreds of gigabytes of DRAM, the highest speed PSA implementations are ASICs that must keep tables in on-chip memories, similar to caches in general purpose CPUs.  The Intel i9-7980XE released in 2017 has 198 Mbits of on-chip L3 cache shared by its CPU cores.  Among Intel processors in Intel's 7th generation Core released in 2017 with at least 100 Mbits of L3 cache, they all cost close to $9 per Mbit of L3 cache.  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_microprocessors>

The P4 Runtime API uses quantities with bit widths independent
of the target device to hold values of the types
listed in section [#sec-psa-type-definitions], to simplify the
manipulation of these values in the controller and agent software.
For control plane
operations on tables, any trimming or padding of values will be
performed in the agent (usually trimming in the direction from
controller to device, and padding in the direction from device
to controller).

There are multiple channels of communication over which such values
might be carried between the controller and the data plane.  These
channels of communication include:

+ Control plane operations on tables, where values of these types may
  be included as part of the key, or as an action parameter.
+ Control plane operations on parser value sets, where values of these
  types may be included as part of the key.
+ Packets sent to the CPU ("packet in" from the controller's
  perspective), or received from the CPU ("packet out" from the
  controller's perspective).
+ Fields in a `Digest` extern notification message (section
  [#sec-packet-digest]).
+ Fields in the data contents of a `Register` array (section
  [#sec-registers]).

Note: There may be other channels not listed above.

For packets between the control plane and the PSA device, there is the
issue that many PSA implementations are expected to restrict P4
programs to have headers with fields with a total length that is a
multiple of 8 bits.  To make it possible to define P4 header types
that meet this restriction, and contain values of fields with these
PSA-specific types, and be source-compatible across multiple PSA
implementations, additional types are defined that contain `InHeader` in
their name.  For example, `PortIdInHeader_t` is the same as `PortId_t`,
except it must be a multiple of 8 bits long, and contain at least as
many bits as `PortId_t` does.

Because these `InHeader` types are guaranteed to be a multiple of 8 bits long,
you may include any combination of them in a P4 header type
definition, as long as the other fields in the header satisfy the
multiple of 8 bits restriction.  The controller or P4 program
generating packets with such headers should fill in any most
significant "padding" bits with 0.  You may do this with a normal
assignment statement in your P4 program, where the value on the
right hand side is cast to the wider `InHeader` type.  Similarly,
casting a value of a wider type such as `PortIdInHeader_t` to the
corresponding narrower type `PortId_t` truncates the excess most
significant bits as part of the cast.

Values of type `PortId_t` have an unusual property in PSA
implementations.  Because it can make some hardware implementations
more straightforward, the numerical values of fields with type
`PortId_t` in the P4 data plane might not be a simple range of values
such as 0 through 31, as one might choose when writing control plane
software for a 32-port device.  The agent is expected to implement
numerical translation between controller port id values and data plane
port id values, for each of the channels of communication between the
controller and data plane described above.

The file `psa.p4` contains an annotation `p4runtime_translation` on
the `type` definition of types `PortId_t` and `PortIdInHeader_t`.
This enables the compiler to mark all uses of values of these types
that are accessible from the P4Runtime API, so the agent software
knows that it must translate them, and what kind of translation to
perform.  The benefit is that you do not need to put any special
markings on your uses of values of these types throughout your P4
program.

The cost of this approach is: if you want to do arithmetic on values
of these types, you must explicitly cast them to a `bit<W>`
type.  The `psa.p4` include file defines `PortIdUint_t` as a `typedef`
with exactly the same width in bits as `type` `PortId_t`, so you can
cast values of type `PortId_t` to type `PortIdUint_t`, and then you
can perform all P4 arithmetic operations on the value.  The result
must be explicitly cast back to type `PortId_t` if you wish to assign
it to a metadata field with that type.  Corresponding types with
`Uint` in their name are defined for all PSA types.

Because of this translation, we recommend that values of type
`PortId_t` be treated similarly to values of an `enum` type.
Comparing two values of this type for equality or "not equal to" is
reasonable, as well as assigning the values to other variables or
parameters of the same type, but nearly any other operations are prone
to error.  When matching values of type `PortId_t` as part of a table
key, always match a complete value exactly, or wildcard every bit of
the value (i.e. a `ternary` match kind with all bits wildcard, or an
`lpm` match kind with prefix length 0).  If you attempt to do any of
the following things on a value with type `PortId_t` or
`PortIdInHeader_t`, the numerical translation performed may lead to
functional errors in your program:

+ Do a table key match on a subset of the bits, or a range match.
+ Compare port values with relational operators like `<` or `>`.
+ Compare port values to specific numeric literal values like 0 or
  0xff.  It is recommended instead to compare their values by using
  them as table key fields, or parser value set key fields, against
  values installed by the control plane (which have been translated to
  the corresponding device-specific value as determined by the
  device's agent software).  It is also reasonable to compare port
  values for equality against the symbolic constant values
  `PSA_PORT_CPU` or `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`, which have target-specific
  numeric values.
+ Perform arithmetic on the value, and expect to get a value that
  corresponds to another port of the device.  Some numerical values
  may not correspond to any port of the device, and the values
  corresponding to ports need not be consecutive.

The list above is not intended to be exhaustive.

All of the comments above apply to all types where numerical
translation occurs between the controller and the data plane.  Below
is a complete list of numeric types planned for numerical translation
by default in PSA:

+ `PortId_t` or `PortIdInHeader_t`
+ `ClassOfService_t` or `ClassOfServiceInHeader_t`

For the types listed below, no numerical translation occurs by
default[^P4CNumericTranslationOptions].  A PSA
data plane must support all numerical values from 0 up to the maximum
value that it supports.  Except for `Timestamp_t` values, the number
of values supported by the data plane need not be a power of 2.
Controllers must have a way to discover each PSA device's maximum
supported value for each of these types.

[^P4CNumericTranslationOptions]: The open source `p4c` P4 compiler is
    planned to support an option to enable numerical translation for
    additional types, without modifying your P4 program, nor the
    `psa.p4` include file.  These additional types would be specified
    by their name.

+ `MulticastGroup_t` - 0 is a special value that indicates no
  multicast replication is to be performed for a packet, so this type
  is an exception to the rule above that 0 must be supported in the
  data plane.
+ `CloneSessionId_t`
+ `PacketLength_t`
+ `EgressInstance_t`
+ `Timestamp_t`

~ TBD
Values of type `Timestamp_t` are being considered for numerical
translation in the agent software, between target-specific values, and
a value with a common unit and 0 value reference across all targts.
~

Note that all of these types have a `p4runtime_translation` annotation
in the `psa.p4` include file.  This is to ensure that when the
compiler generates a P4Runtime P4Info file from source programs, it
will include in the P4Info file the type specified by the
`p4runtime_translation` rather than the target-specific bit width.
For the same P4 source program, the P4Info file contents are intended
to be identical for all targets.

If the type bitwidth specified as the second parameter to the
`p4runtime_translation` is different from the device-specific bitwidth
(of the underlying type), we expect the P4Runtime server to perform
the appropriate casting. Additionally, more advanced numerical
translation can be enabled at runtime for any type annotated with
`p4runtime_translation`, although arbitrary numerical translation is
only mandated for `PortId_t`, `ClassOfService_t`, and their `Inheader`
variants. To request arbitrary numerical translation for a give type,
the P4Runtime system will expect the URI (first parameter to the
`p4runtime_translation`) and the desired mapping.


# Programmable blocks {#sec-programmable-blocks}

The following declarations provide a template for the programmable
blocks in the PSA. The P4 programmer is responsible for
implementing controls that match these interfaces and instantiate
them in a package definition.

It uses the same user-defined metadata type `IM` and header type `IH`
for all ingress parsers and control blocks.  The egress parser and
control blocks can use the same types for those things, or different
types, as the P4 program author wishes.

Note that the `ingress_port` value for a resubmitted packet could be
`PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE` if a packet was recirculated, and then that
recirculated packet was resubmitted.

### Initial packet contents for packets from ports

For Ethernet ports, `packet_in` for FP and NFCPU path packets contains
the Ethernet frame starting with the Ethernet header.  It does not
include the Ethernet frame CRC.

~ TBD
Whether the payload is always the
minimum of 46 bytes (64 byte minimum Ethernet frame size, minus 14
bytes of header, minus 4 bytes of CRC), or whether an implementation
is allowed to leave some of those bytes out.}
~

The PSA does not put further restrictions on `packet_in.length()`
as defined in the P4~16~ spec. Targets that do not support it, should provide mechanisms
to raise an error.

The P4 Runtime has a "Packet Out" capability to send a packet from the
controller to a PSA device.  Such packets are sent into the PSA device
as NFCPU path packets.  There is no metadata associated with such
packets, only the contents of the packet that are parsed normally by
the P4 program's IngressParser code.  There may be some translation of
header field values, as described in Section
[#sec-data-plane-vs-control-plane-values].


### Initial packet contents for resubmitted packets

For RESUB packets, `packet_in` is the same as the pre-IngressParser
contents of `packet_in`, for the packet that caused this resubmitted
packet to occur (i.e. with NO modifications from any ingress processing).

### Initial packet contents for recirculated packets

For RECIRC packets, `packet_in` is created by starting with the
headers emitted by the egress deparser of the egress packet that was
recirculated, followed by the payload of that packet, i.e. the part
that was not parsed by the egress parser.

### User-defined metadata for all ingress packets {#sec-ingress_initial-metadata}

The PSA architecture does not mandate initialization of user-defined
metadata to known values as given as input to the ingress parser.  If
a user's P4 program explicitly initializes all user-defined metadata
early on (e.g. in the parser's `start` state), then that will flow
through the rest of the parser into the `Ingress` control block as one
might normally expect.  This will be left as an option to the user in
their P4 programs, not required behavior for all P4 programs.

There are two direction `in` parameters to the ingress parser with
user-defined types, named `resubmit_meta` and `recirculate_meta`.
They may be used to carry metadata for resubmitted and recirculated
packets.

Consider a packet that arrives at the ingress pipeline, and during
ingress processing the P4 program assigns values to fields of the PSA
standard metadata such that the packet is resubmitted (see Section
[#sec-after-ingress] for details on how to do so).  In the ingress
deparser, the P4 program assigns a value to the `out` parameter named
`resubmit_meta`.  This value (which can be a collection of many
individual values in fields, sub-structs, headers, etc.) becomes
associated with the resubmitted packet by the PSA implementation, and
when the resubmitted packet begins ingress parsing, that becomes the
value of the `in` parameter named `resubmit_meta` to the ingress
parser.

For resubmitted packets, the value of the `in` parameter named
`recirculate_meta` is undefined.

Conversely, for recirculated packets, the value of the `in` parameter
named `recirculate_meta` contains whatever value was assigned to the
egress deparser `out` parameter named `recirculate_meta` when the
packet was recirculated.  The value of the `in` parameter
`resubmit_meta` is undefined for recirculated packets.

For packets from a port, including the CPU port, both of the `in`
parameters `resubmit_meta` and `recirculate_meta` are undefined.


## Behavior of packets after ingress processing is complete {#sec-after-ingress}

The pseudocode below defines where copies of packets will be made
after the `Ingress` control block has completed executing, based upon
the contents of several metadata fields in the struct
`psa_ingress_output_metadata_t`.

The function `platform_port_valid()` mentioned below takes a value of
type `PortId_t`, returning `true` only when the value represents an
output port for the implementation. It is expected that for some PSA
implementations there will be bit patterns for a value of type
`PortId_t` that do not correspond to any port. This function returns
true for both `PSA_PORT_CPU` and `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`. `platform_port_valid`
is not defined in PSA for calling from the P4 data-plane program,
since there is no known use case for calling it at packet processing
time. It is intended for describing the behavior in pseudocode.  The
control plane is expected to configure tables with valid port numbers.

A comment saying "recommended to log error" is not a requirement, but
a recommendation, that a PSA implementation should maintain a counter
that counts the number of times this error occurs.  It would also be
useful if the implementation recorded details about the first few
times this error occurred, e.g. a FIFO queue of the first several
invalid values of `ostd.egress_port` that cause an error to occur,
perhaps with other information about the packet that caused it, with
tail dropping if it fills up.  Control plane or driver software would
be able to read these counters, and read and drain the FIFO queues to
assist P4 developers in debugging their code.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_ingress_output]
```

First we give an outline of behavior, for quick reference of the
relative priority of the possible actions.  This outline is only for
reader convenience -- it is not the specification for the behavior.

```
    psa_ingress_output_metadata_t ostd;

    if (ostd.clone) {
        create ingress to egress clone(s), with options as configured by
            the PRE clone session numbered ostd.clone_session_id;
    } else { no clone; }

    if (ostd.drop) { drop packet; }
    else if (ostd.resubmit) { resubmit packet; }
    else if (ostd.multicast_group != 0) { PRE multicast replicates packet; }
    else { PRE sends one copy of packet to ostd.egress_port; }
```

The pseucode below defines the behavior a PSA implementation must
follow.

```
    psa_ingress_output_metadata_t ostd;

    if (ostd.clone) {
        if (ostd.clone_session_id value is supported) {
            from the values configured for ostd.clone_session_id in PRE {
                cos = class_of_service
                set((egress_port[0], instance[0]), ..., (egress_port[n], instance[n])) =
                    set of egress_port and instance pairs
                trunc = truncate
                plen = packet_length_bytes
            }
            if (cos value is not supported) {
                cos = 0;
                // Recommmended to log error about unsupported cos value.
            }
            for each pair (egress_port, instance) in the set {
                Create a clone of the packet and send it to the packet
                buffer with the egress_port, instance, and
                class_of_service cos, after which it will start egress
                processing.  It will contain at most the first plen
                bytes of the packet as received at the ingress parser
                if trunc is true, otherwise the entire packet.
            }
        } else {
            // Do not create a clone.  Recommmended to log error about
            // unsupported ostd.clone_session_id value.
        }
    }
    // Continue below, regardless of whether a clone was created.
    // Any clone created above is unaffected by the code below.
    if (ostd.drop) {
        drop the packet
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (ostd.class_of_service value is not supported) {
        ostd.class_of_service = 0;    // use default class 0 instead
        // Recommended to log error about unsupported
        // ostd.class_of_service value.
    }
    if (ostd.resubmit) {
        resubmit the packet, i.e. it will go back to starting with the
            ingress parser;
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (ostd.multicast_group != 0) {
        Make 0 or more copies of the packet according to the control
            plane configuration of multicast group ostd.multicast_group.
            Every copy will have the same value of ostd.class_of_service
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    if (platform_port_valid(ostd.egress_port)) {
        enqueue one packet for output port ostd.egress_port with class
            of service ostd.class_of_service
    } else {
        drop the packet
        // Recommended to log error about unsupported ostd.egress_port value.
    }
```

Whenever the pseudocode above indicates that a packet should be sent
on a particular packet path, a PSA implementation may under some
circumstances instead drop the packet.  For example, the packet buffer
may be too low on available space for storing new packets, or some
other congestion control mechanism such as RED (Random Early
Detection) or AFD (Approximate Fair Dropping) may select the packet
for dropping.  It is recommended that an implementation maintain
counters of packets dropped, preferably with separate counters for as
many different reasons as the implementation has for dropping packets
outside the control of the P4 program.

A PSA implementation may implement multiple classes of service for
packets sent to the packet buffer.  If so, the `Ingress` control block
may choose to assign a value to the `ostd.class_of_service` field to
change the packet's class of service to a value other than the default
of 0.

PSA only specifies how the `Ingress` control block can control the class
of service of packets.  PSA does not mandate a scheduling policy among
queues that may exist in the packet buffer.  Something at least as
flexible as weighted fair queuing, with an optional strict high
priority queue, is recommended for PSA implementations with separate
queues for each class of service.  See appendix
[#appendix-packet-ordering] for more on packet ordering
recommendations in PSA devices.

The P4 Runtime API specification defines how a controller may discover
the number of distinct class of service values that a PSA device
supports.


### Multicast replication {#sec-multicast}

The control plane may configure each `multicast_group` in the PRE to
create the desired copies of packets sent to that group.  Each group
begins empty.  Sending a packet to an empty group causes the packet to
be dropped.  The control plane may add one or more pairs of the form
`(egress_port, instance)` to a multicast group, and may also remove
pairs from a group that were added earlier.

Suppose a multicast group contains the following set of pairs:

```
    (egress_port[0], instance[0]),
    (egress_port[1], instance[1]),
    ...,
    (egress_port[N-1], instance[N-1])
```

When a packet is sent to that group, `N` copies of the packet are
made.  Copy number `i` that is sent to egress processing will have its
`struct` of type `psa_egress_input_metadata_t` filled in with the
field `egress_port` equal to `egress_port[i]`, and the field
`instance` filled in with `instance[i]`.  Note: A multicast group is a
set of pairs, and it is not required that an implementation create
copies in an order that the control plane can enforce.  See appendix
[#appendix-packet-ordering] for more on packet ordering
recommendations in PSA devices.

Within a single multicast group, the pairs `(egress_port, instance)`
must be different from each other, but it is allowed for any number of
pairs within a multicast group to have the same value of
`egress_port`, or to have the same value of `instance`.  The same pair
`(egress_port, instance)` can occur in any number of different
multicast groups.

A PSA implementation need only support `egress_port` values that
represent single ports of the PSA device.  That is, it need not
implement support for `egress_port` values that represent an entire
Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface, which is a set of physical
ports over which load balancing of traffic is performed.

A PSA device must support `egress_port` values in a multicast group
that are equal to `PSA_PORT_CPU` or `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`.  The copies of a
multicast packet made to those ports will behave the same in egress as
a unicast packets sent to the corresponding port, i.e. if not dropped,
those copies will go the the CPU port, or be recirculated back to
ingress.


## Actions for directing packets during ingress {#sec-ingress-actions}

All of these actions modify one or more metadata fields in the struct
with type `psa_ingress_output_metadata_t` that is an `inout` parameter
of the `Ingress` control block.  None of these actions have any other
immediate effect.  What happens to the packet is determined by the
value of all fields in that struct when ingress processing is
complete, not at the time one of these actions is called.  See Section
[#sec-after-ingress].

These actions are provided for convenience in making changes to these
metadata fields.  Their effects are expected to be common kinds of
changes one will want to make in a P4 program.  If they do not suit
your use cases, you may modify the metadata fields directly in your P4
programs however you prefer, e.g. within actions you define.


### Unicast operation

Sends packet to a port.  See Table [#egress-initial-values], column
NU, for how metadata fields are filled in when such a packet begins
egress processing.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_send_to_port]
```

### Multicast operation

Sends packet to a multicast group or a port.  See Table
[#egress-initial-values], column NM, for how metadata fields are
filled in when each multicast-replicated copy of such a packet begins
egress processing.

The `multicast_group` parameter is the multicast group id.  The
control plane must configure the multicast groups through a separate
mechanism such as the P4 Runtime API.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_multicast]
```

### Drop operation

Do not send a copy of the packet for normal egress processing.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_ingress_drop]
```

### Initial packet contents for normal packets

For NU and NM packets, `packet_in` comes from the ingress packet that
caused this packet to be sent to egress.  It starts with the packet
headers as emitted by the ingress deparser, followed by the payload of
that packet, i.e. the part that was not parsed by the ingress parser.

Packets to be recirculated, i.e. those sent to port `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`
via the normal unicast or multicast packet paths, fit into this
category.  They are not treated differently by a PSA implementation
from normal unicast or multicast packets until they reach the egress
deparser.

### Initial packet contents for packets cloned from ingress to egress

For CI2E packets, `packet_in` is from the ingress packet that caused
this clone to be created.  It is the same as the pre-IngressParser
contents of `packet_in` of that ingress packet, with no modifications
from any ingress processing.  Truncation of the payload is supported.

Packets cloned in ingress using a clone session configured with
`egress_port` equal to `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE` fit into this category.


### Initial packet contents for packets cloned from egress to egress

For CE2E packets, `packet_in` is from the egress packet that caused this
clone to be created.  It starts with the headers emitted by the egress
deparser, followed by the payload of that packet, i.e. the part that
was not parsed by the egress parser.  Truncation of the payload is
supported.

Packets cloned in egress using a clone session configured with
`egress_port` equal to `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE` fit into this category.


### User-defined metadata for all egress packets

This is very similar to how metadata is initialized for ingress
packets.  See Section [#sec-ingress_initial-metadata].

The primary differences for egress packets are the different packet
paths involved.  There are three parameters with direction `in` for
the egress parser, named `normal_meta`, `clone_i2e_meta`, and
`clone_e2e_meta`.  For every packet that begins egress processing,
exactly one of those three has defined contents, and the other two
have undefined contents.

For NU and NM packets, the parameter `normal_meta` is the only one
with defined contents.  Its value is the one that was assigned to the
`out` parameter with the same name of the ingress deparser, when the
normal packet was completing its ingress processing.

For CLONE_I2E packets, the parameter `clone_i2e_meta` is the only one
with defined contents.  Its value is the one that was assigned to the
`out` parameter with the same name of the ingress deparser, when the
clone was created.

For CLONE_E2E packets, the parameter `clone_e2e_meta` is the only one
with defined contents.  Its value is the one that was assigned to the
`out` parameter with the same name of the egress deparser, when the
clone was created.


### Multicast and clone copies

The following fields may differ among copies of a multicast-replicated
packet that are processed in egress.  Similarly for copies of a cloned
packet when they are processed in egress.  Both are referred to as
replicated packets in this section.

+ `egress_port` - This field will typically differ among copies of a
  replicated packet, but it may also be the same for
  arbitrary copies, as determined by the control plane configuration
  of the PacketReplicationEngine.  It is expected that the control
  plane will configure the PacketReplicationEngine so that each copy
  of the same original packet is assigned a unique value of the pair
  `(egress_port, instance)`.
+ `instance` - See `egress_port`
+ `egress_timestamp` - This value is filled in independently for each
  copy of a replicated packet.  Depending upon the quantity
  of traffic destined to each output port, the timestamp could vary
  significantly between copies of the same original packet.
+ `parser_error` - In the common case, this will typically be the same
  for every copy of the same original replicated packet.
  However, it is determined by the EgressParser P4 code for each copy
  independently, so if that parsing behavior depends upon a field that
  can differ among copies, e.g. `egress_port`, then `parser_error`
  can differ among copies.

All contents of a packet and its associated metadata, other than those
mentioned above, will be the same for every copy of the same original
replicated packet.


## Behavior of packets after egress processing is complete {#sec-after-egress}


The pseudocode below defines where copies of packets will be made
after the `Egress` control block has completed executing, based upon
the contents of several metadata fields in the struct
`psa_egress_output_metadata_t`.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Metadata_egress_output]

    psa_egress_input_metadata_t  istd;
    psa_egress_output_metadata_t ostd;

    if (ostd.clone) {
        if (ostd.clone_session_id value is supported) {
            from the values configured for ostd.clone_session_id in PRE {
                cos = class_of_service
                set((egress_port[0], instance[0]), ..., (egress_port[n], instance[n])) =
                    set of egress_port and instance pairs
                trunc = truncate
                plen = packet_length_bytes
            }
            if (cos value is not supported) {
                cos = 0;
                // Recommmended to log error about unsupported cos
                // value.
            }
            for each pair (egress_port, instance) in the set {
                Create a clone of the packet and send it to the packet
                buffer with the egress_port, instance, and
                class_of_service cos, after which it will start egress
                processing.  It will contain at most the first plen
                bytes of the packet as sent out from the egress
                deparser if trunc is true, otherwise the entire
                packet.
            }
        } else {
            // Do not create a clone.  Recommmended to log error about
            // unsupported ostd.clone_session_id value.
        }
    }
    // Continue below, regardless of whether a clone was created.
    // Any clone created above is unaffected by the code below.
    if (ostd.drop) {
        drop the packet
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    // The value istd.egress_port below is the same one that the
    // packet began its egress processing with, as decided during
    // ingress processing for this packet (or as determined by the PRE
    // configuration of a clone session, for cloned packets,
    // regardless of whether the clone operation was done in ingress
    // or egress).  The egress code is not allowed to change it.
    if (istd.egress_port == PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE) {
        recirculate the packet, i.e. it will go back to starting with the
            ingress parser;
        return;   // Do not continue below.
    }
    enqueue one packet for output port istd.egress_port
```

As for the handling of a packet after ingress processing, a PSA
implementation may drop a packet after egress processing, even if the
pseudocode above says that a packet will be sent.  For example, you
may attempt to clone a packet after egress when the packet buffer is
too full, or you may attempt to recirculate a packet when the ingress
pipeline is busy handling other packets.  It is recommended that an
implementation maintain counters of packets dropped, preferably with
separate counters for as many different reasons as the implementation
has for dropping packets outside the control of the P4 program.


## Actions for directing packets during egress {#sec-egress-actions}

### Drop operation {#sec-bqe-drop}

Do not send the packet out of the device after egress processing is
complete.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Action_egress_drop]
```


## Contents of packets sent out to ports

There is no metadata associated with NTP and NTCPU packets.

They begin with the series of bytes emitted by the egress deparser.
Following that is the payload, which are those packet bytes that were
not parsed in the egress parser.

For Ethernet ports, any padding required to get the packet up to the
minimum frame size required is done by the implementation, as well as
calculation of and appending the Ethernet frame CRC.

It is expected that typical P4 programs will have explicit checks to
avoid sending packets larger than a port's maximum frame size.  A
typical implementation will drop frames larger than this maximum
supported size.  It is recommended that they maintain error counters
for such dropped frames.

The P4 Runtime has a "Packet In" capability to receive packets sent by
a PSA device to the port `PSA_PORT_CPU`.  There is no metadata
associated with such packets, only the contents of the packet that are
emitted normally by the P4 program's EgressDeparser code.  There may
be some translation of header field values, as described in Section
[#sec-psa-type-definitions].


## Packet Cloning  {#sec-clone}

Packet cloning is a mechanism to send a copy of a packet to a
specified port, in addition to the 'regular' packet.  Multiple clones
can be made via a single clone operation, by appropriate control plane
configuration.

One use case for cloning is packet mirroring, i.e. send the packet to
its normal destination according to other features implemented by the
P4 program, and in addition, send a copy of the packet as received to
another output port, e.g. to a monitoring device.

Packet cloning happens at the end of the ingress and/or egress
pipeline. PSA specifies the following semantics for the clone
operation.  When the clone operation is invoked at the end of the
ingress pipeline, each cloned packet is a copy of the packet as it
entered the ingress parser.  When the clone operation is invoked at
the end of the egress pipeline, each cloned packet is a copy of the
modified packet after egress processing, as output by the egress
deparser.  In both cases, the cloned packets are submitted to the egress
pipeline for further processing.

Logically, PRE implements the mechanics of copying a packet.  The
metadata fields that control cloning are those whose names begin with
`clone` in types `psa_ingress_output_metadata_t` and
`psa_egress_output_metadata_t`.

```
bool                     clone;
CloneSessionId_t         clone_session_id;
```

The `clone` flag specifies whether a packet should be cloned.  If
true, then a cloned packet, or packets, should be generated at the end of the
pipeline.  The `clone_session_id` specifies one of several possible
clone sessions that the control plane may configure in the PRE.  For
each clone session, the control plane may configure the following
values that should be associated with packets cloned using that
session.

```
/// Each clone session may configure zero or more pairs of (egress_port, instance).
PortId_t         egress_port;  /// egress_port in a pair of (egress_port, instance)
EgressInstance_t instance;  /// instance in a pair of (egress_port, instance)

/// Each clone session has configuration for exactly one of each of
/// the following values.
ClassOfService_t class_of_service;
bool             truncate;
PacketLength_t   packet_length_bytes;  /// only used if truncate is true
```

The configuration of the set of `(egress_port, instance)` values for a
clone session is similar to, and has the same requirements and
restrictions as, the configuration of a set of pairs for a multicast
group, as described in Section [#sec-multicast].

The `egress_port` values may be any ports that can be used for normal
unicast packets, i.e. any normal port, `PSA_PORT_CPU`, or
`PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`. For the latter two values, the cloned packet
will be sent to the CPU, or recirculated at the end of egress
processing, as a normal unicast packet would at the end of egress
processing.

Truncation of cloned packets is supported as an optimization to
reduce the bandwidth required to send the beginning of packets.  This
is sometimes useful in sending packet headers to the control plane, or
some kinds of data collection system for traffic monitoring.  Here by
"headers" we simply mean "some number of bytes from the beginning of
the packet", not headers as defined and parsed in your P4 program.

If `truncate` is false for a clone session, then no truncation is
performed for packets cloned using that session.

Otherwise, packets are truncated to contain at most the first
`packet_length_bytes` bytes of the packet, with any additional bytes
removed.  Truncating a packet has no effect on any metadata that is
carried along with it, and the size of that metadata is not counted as
part of the `packet_length_bytes` quantity.  Any truncation is based
completely upon the length of the packet as passed to the type
`packet_in` parameter to the ingress parser (for ingress to egress
clones), or as sent out as the type `packet_out` parameter from the
egress deparser (for egress to egress clones).

PSA implementations are allowed to support only a restricted set of
possible values for `packet_length_bytes`, e.g. an implementation
might choose only to support values that are multiples of 32 bytes.

Since it is an expected common case to clone packets to the CPU, every
PSA implementation begins with a clone session
`PSA_CLONE_SESSION_TO_CPU` initialized with the set of (`egress_port`,
`instance`) values containing exactly one pair with
`egress_port = PSA_PORT_CPU` and `instance = 0`.  This clone session
is also initialized with the configuration values
`class_of_service = 0`, and `truncate = false`.


### Clone Examples {#sec-clone-examples}

The partial program below demonstrates how to clone a packet.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part1]
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part2]
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-clone-to-port.p4:Clone_Example_Part3]
```

## Packet Resubmission  {#sec-resubmit}

Packet resubmission is a mechanism to repeat ingress processing on a
packet.

Packet resubmission happens at the end of the ingress pipeline. When a
packet is resubmitted, the packet finishes the ingress pipeline
processing and re-enters the ingress parser without being deparsed. In
other words, the resubmitted packet has the same header and payload as
the original packet. The `ingress_port` of the resubmitted packet is
the same as the original packet. The `packet_path` of the resubmitted
packet is changed to `RESUBMIT`.

The ingress parser distinguishes the resubmitted packet from the
original packet with the `packet_path` field in
`ingress_parser_intrinsic_metadata_t`. The ingress parser can choose a
different algorithm to parse the resubmitted packet. Similarly, the
ingress pipeline can choose to process the resubmitted packet with
different actions as opposed to the ones used to process the original
packet. Further, if a target permits the same packet to be resubmitted
multiple times, the user program can distinguish the packet
resubmitted the first time, or second time, by the extra metadata
associated with the packet.  Note the maximum number of packet
resubmission for a single packet is target-dependent.  See section
[#packet-paths].

PSA specifies that the resubmit operation can only be used in the
ingress pipeline. The egress pipeline cannot resubmit packets. As
described in Section [#packet-paths], there is no mandated mechanism
in PSA to prevent a single received packet from creating packets that
continue to recirculate, resubmit, or clone from egress to egress
indefinitely. However, targets may impose limits on the number of
resubmissions, recirculations, or clones.

One use case of packet resubmission is to increase the capacity and
flexibility of the packet processing pipeline. For example, because
the same packet is processed by the ingress pipeline multiple times,
it effectively increase the amount of operations on the packet by N
folds, where N is the number of times the packet is resubmitted.

Another use case is to deploy multiple packet processing algorithms on
the same packet. For example, the original packet can be parsed and
resubmitted in the first pass with additional metadata to select one
of the algorithms. Then, the resubmitted packet can be parsed,
modified and deparsed using the selected algorithm.

To facilitate communication from the ingress processing pass that
caused a resubmit to occur, to the next ingress processing pass after
the resubmit has happened, the resubmission mechanism supports
attaching optional metadata with the resubmitted packet.  The metadata
is generated during the pass through the ingress pipeline that chooses
the resubmit operation, and used in the next pass.

A PSA implementation provides a configuration bit `resubmit` to the
PRE to enable the resubmission mechanism. If true, the original packet
is resubmitted with the optional resubmit metadata. If false, the
resubmission mechanism is disabled and no assignments to
`resubmit_meta` should be performed.


## Packet Recirculation {#sec-recirculate}

Packet recirculation is a mechanism to repeat ingress processing on a
packet, after it has completed egress processing.  Unlike a resubmit,
where the resubmitted packet contents are identical to the packet that
arrived at the ingress parser, a recirculated packet may have
different headers than the packet had before recirculation.  This
could be useful in implementing features such as multiple levels of
tunnel encapsulation or decapsulation.

Whether a packet is recirculated must be chosen during ingress
processing, by sending the packet to port `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`.  Packet
recirculation happens at the end of the egress pipeline.  When a
packet is sent to the recirculate port, the packet finishes egress
processing, including the egress deparser, and then re-enters the
ingress parser.  The `ingress_port` of the recirculated packet is set
to `PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`. The `packet_path` of the recirculated packet is
set to `RECIRCULATE`.

Similar to packet resubmission, packet recirculation also supports
attaching optional metadata with the recirculated packet.  The
metadata is generated during egress processing, and filled in by
assigning a value to the `out` parameter `recirculate_meta` of the
egress deparser.  The metadata is available to the ingress parser
after the packet is recirculated.


# PSA Externs

## Restrictions on where externs may be used {#sec-extern-restrictions}

All instantiations in a P4~16~ program occur at compile time, and can
be arranged in a tree structure we will call the instantiation tree.
The root of the tree `T` represents the top level of the program.  Its
children are the node for the package `PSA_Switch` described in
Section [#sec-programmable-blocks], and any externs instantiated at
the top level of the program.  The children of the `PSA_Switch` node
are the packages and externs passed as parameters to the `PSA_Switch`
instantiation.  See Figure [#fig-instantiation-tree] for a drawing of
the smallest instantiation tree possible for a P4 program written for
PSA.

~ Figure {#fig-instantiation-tree; caption: "Minimal PSA instantiation tree"; page-align: here;}
![instantiation-tree]
~
[instantiation-tree]: figs/psa-instantiation-tree-figure.png { width: 100%;}


If any of those parsers or controls instantiate other parsers,
controls, and/or externs, the instantiation tree contains child nodes
for them, continuing until the instantiation tree is complete.

For every instance whose node is a descendant of the `Ingress` node in
this tree, call it an `Ingress` instance.  Similarly for the other
ingress and egress parsers and controls.  All other instances are top
level instances.

A PSA implementation is allowed to reject programs that instantiate
externs, or attempt to call their methods, from anywhere other than
the places mentioned in Table [#table-extern-usage].

~ TableFigure {#table-extern-usage; \
  caption: Summary of controls that can instantiate and invoke externs.}
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Extern type       | Where it may be instantiated and called from |
+:------------------+:---------------------------------------------+
| `ActionProfile`   | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ActionSelector`  | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Checksum`        | IngressParser, EgressParser, IngressDeparser, EgressDeparser |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Counter`         | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Digest`          | IngressDeparser |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DirectCounter`   | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DirectMeter`     | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Hash`            | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `InternetChecksum` | IngressParser, EgressParser, IngressDeparser, EgressDeparser |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Meter`           | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Random`          | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Register`        | Ingress, Egress |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
~

For example, `Counter` being restricted to "Ingress, Egress" means
that every `Counter` instance must be instantiated within either the
`Ingress` control block or the `Egress` control block, or be a descendant
of one of those nodes in the instantiation tree.  If a `Counter`
instance is instantiated in Ingress, for example, then it cannot be
referenced, and thus its methods cannot be called, from any control
block except `Ingress` or one of its descendants in the tree.

PSA implementations need not support instantiating these externs at
the top level.  PSA implementations are allowed to accept programs
that use these externs in other places, but they need not.  Thus P4
programmers wishing to maximize the portability of their programs
should restrict their use of these externs to the places indicated in
the table.

`emit` method calls for the type `packet_out` are restricted to be
within deparser control blocks in PSA, because those are the only
places where an instance of type `packet_out` is visible.  Similarly
all methods for type `packet_in`, e.g. `extract` and `advance`, are
restricted to be within parsers in PSA programs.  P4~16~ restricts all
`verify` method calls to be within parsers for all P4~16~ programs,
regardless of whether they are for the PSA.

Rationale:

- It is expected that the highest performance PSA implementations will
  not be able to update the same extern instance from both `Ingress` and
  Egress, nor from more than one of the parsers or controls defined in
  the PSA architecture.
- In a multi-pipeline device, there are effectively multiple
  instantiations of the ingress pipeline and of the egress pipeline.
  The primary motivation to create a multi-pipeline device is the
  practical difficulty in allowing the same stateful object
  (e.g. table, counter, etc.) to be accessed at a packet rate higher
  than that of a single pipeline.  Thus each stateful object should be
  accessed from only a single pipeline on such a device.
  See appendix [#appendix-multi-pipeline-psa-devices].


## PSA Table Properties

Table [#table-table-properties] lists all P4 table properties defined
by PSA that are not included in the base P4~16~ language
specification.

|-----------------------|------|---------------------------------------|
~

A PSA implementation need not support both of a `psa_implementation`
and `psa_direct_counter` property on the same table.

Similarly, a PSA implementation need not support both of a
`psa_implementation` and `psa_direct_meter` property on the same
table.

A PSA implementation must implement tables that have both a
`psa_direct_counter` and `psa_direct_meter` property.

A PSA implementation need not support both `psa_implementation` and
`psa_idle_timeout` properties on the same table.

### Table entry timeout notification {#sec-idle-timeout}

PSA uses the `psa_idle_timeout` to enable a table implementation send
notifications from the PSA device when a configurable time has passed since an
entry was last matched. The property may take one of two values --
`NO_TIMEOUT`, and `NOTIFY_CONTROL`. `NO_TIMEOUT` disables idle timeout support
for the table and it is the default value when the property is not present.
`NOTIFY_CONTROL` enables the notification. A PSA implementation will then
generate an API for the control plane to set time-to-live (TTL) values for table
entries and if at any time during its lifetime, the table entry is not "hit"
(&ie; not selected by any packet lookup) for a lapse of time greater or equal
to its TTL, the device should generate a notification to the control plane.
The rate and mode of how the notifications are generated and delivered to the
control plane are subject to configuration parameters specified by the control
plane API.

Example:
```
enum PSA_IdleTimeout_t {
  NO_TIMEOUT,
  NOTIFY_CONTROL
}

table t {
  action a1 () { ... }
  action a2 () { ... }
  key = { hdr.f1: exact; }
  actions = { a1; a2; }
  default_action = a2;
  psa_idle_timeout = PSA_IdleTimeout_t.NOTIFY_CONTROL;
}
```

Restrictions on the TTL values and notifications:

- It is likely that any hardware implementation will have a limited number of
  bits to represent the values, and, since the values are programmed at
  runtime, it is the responsibility of the runtime (P4Runtime or other
  controller software) to guarantee that the TTL values can be represented in
  the device. This can be done by scaling the values to the number of bits
  available on the platform, ensuring that the range of values between
  different entries are representable. A PSA implementation should only enable
  the programming of such tables, and return an error if the device does not
  support the idle timeout at all.

- If no value is programmed for a table entry, even though the table has
  enabled the idle timeout property, the entry will not generate a
  notification.

- PSA does not require a timeout value for a default action entry. The reason
  for not making this mandatory in the specification is that tthe default
  action may not have an explicit table entry to represent it, and also there
  are no known compelling use cases for a controller knowing when no misses
  have occurred for a particular table for a long time. The default action entry will not be aged out.

- Currently, tables implemented using ActionSelectors and ActionProfiles do not support the `psa_idle_timeout` property. Future versions of the specification may remove this restriction.

## Packet Replication Engine {#sec-pre}

The `PacketReplicationEngine` extern (abbreviated PRE) represents
a part of the PSA pipeline that is not programmable via writing P4
code.

Even though the PRE can not be programmed using P4, it can be
configured using control plane APIs, e.g. configuring multicast groups
and clone sessions.  For every packet, your P4 program will typically
assign values to intrinsic metadata in structs such as those of type
`psa_ingress_output_metadata_t` and `psa_egress_output_metadata_t`,
which direct the operation of the PRE on that packet.  The file
`psa.p4` defines some actions to help set these metadata fields for
some common use cases, described in sections [#sec-ingress-actions]
and [#sec-egress-actions].

The PRE extern must be instantiated exactly once, in the `PSA_Switch`
package instantiation.  See near the end of Section
[#sec-programmable-blocks] for the package definitions from `psa.p4`.
See below for an example of instantiating these packages, including
the instantiation of one instance of `PacketReplicationEngine` and one
of `BufferingQueueingEngine` in the `PSA_Switch` package
instantiation.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-counters.p4:Package_Instantiation_Example]
```


## Buffering Queuing Engine {#sec-bqe}

The `BufferingQueueingEngine` extern (abbreviated BQE) represents
another part of the PSA pipeline, after egress, that is not
programmable via writing P4 code.

Even though the BQE can not be programmed using P4, it can be
configured both directly using control plane APIs and by setting
intrinsic metadata.

The BQE extern must be instantiated exactly once, as the PRE must.
See Section [#sec-pre] for additional discussion and example code.


## Hashes {#sec-hash-algorithms}

Supported hash algorithms:
```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Hash_algorithms]
```

### Hash function

Example usage:

```
parser P() {
  Hash<bit<16>>(PSA_HashAlgorithm_t.CRC16) h;
  bit<16> hash_value = h.get_hash(buffer);
}
```

Parameters:

- `algo` -- The algorithm to use for computation (see [#sec-hash-algorithms]).
- `O`       -- The type of the return value of the hash.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Hash_extern]
```

## Checksums {#sec-checksums}

PSA provides checksum functions compute an integer on the stream of
bytes in packet headers. Checksums are often used as an integrity
check to detect corrupted or otherwise malformed packets.

### Basic checksum {#sec-basic-checksum}

The basic checksum extern provided in PSA supports arbitrary hash
algorithms.

Parameters:

- `W`   -- The width of the checksum

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Checksum_extern]
```

### Incremental checksum {#sec-incremental-checksum}

PSA also provides an incremental checksum that comes equipped with an
additional `subtract` method that can be used to remove data previously
added. The checksum is computed using the `ONES_COMPLEMENT16` hash
algorithm used with protocols such as IPv4, TCP, and UDP -- see [IETF
RFC 1624](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1624)
and section [#appendix-internetchecksum-implementation] for details.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:InternetChecksum_extern]
```

### InternetChecksum examples {#sec-checksum-examples}


The partial program below demonstrates one way to use the `InternetChecksum`
extern to verify whether the checksum field in a parsed IPv4 header is
correct, and set a parser error if it is wrong.  It also demonstrates
checking for parser errors in the `Ingress` control block, dropping
the packet if any errors occurred during parsing.  PSA programs may
choose to handle packets with parser errors in other ways than shown
in this example -- it is up to the P4 program author to choose and
write the desired behavior.

Neither P4~16~ nor the PSA provide any special mechanisms to record
the location within a packet that a parser error occurred. A P4
program author can choose to record such location information
explicitly. For example, one may define metadata fields specifically
for that purpose -- e.g. to hold an encoded value representing the last
parser state reached, or the number of bytes extracted so far -- and then
assign values to those fields within the parser state code.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-parser-checksum.p4:Parse_Error_Example]
```

The partial program below demonstrates one way to use the `InternetChecksum`
extern to calculate and then fill in a correct IPv4 header checksum in
the deparser block.  In this example, the checksum is calculated
fresh, so the outgoing checksum will be correct regardless of what
changes might have been made to the IPv4 header fields in the Ingress
(or Egress) control block that precedes it.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-parser-checksum.p4:Compute_New_IPv4_Checksum_Example]
```

As a final example, we can use the `InternetChecksum` to compute an
incremental checksum for the TCP header. Recall the TCP checksum is
computed over the _entire_ packet, including the payload. Because the
packet payload need not be available in a PSA implementation, we
assume that the TCP checksum
on the original packet is correct, and update it incrementally by
invoking `subtract` and then `add` on any fields that are modified by
the program. For example, the `Ingress` control in the program below
updates the IPv4 source address, recording the original source address
in a metadata field:
```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-incremental-checksum.p4:Incremental_Checksum_Table]
```
The deparser first updates the IPv4 checksum as above, and then
incrementally computes the TCP checksum.
```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-incremental-checksum.p4:Incremental_Checksum_Example]
```

## Counters

Counters are a mechanism for keeping statistics.  The control plane
can read counter values.  A P4 program cannot read counter values,
only update them.  If you wish to implement a feature involving
sequence numbers in packets, for example, use Registers instead
(Section [#sec-registers]).

Direct counters are counters associated with a particular P4 table,
and are implemented by the extern `DirectCounter`.  There are also
indexed counters, which are implemented by the extern `Counter`.  The
primary differences between direct counters and indexed counters are:

- Number of independently updatable counter values:
  - A single instantiation of a direct counter always contains as many
    independent counter values as the number of entries in the table
    with which it is associated.
  - You must specify the number of independent counter values for an
    indexed counter when instantiating it.  This number of counters
    need not be the same as the size of any table.
- Where counter updates are allowed in the P4 program:
  - For a direct counter, you may only invoke its `count` method from
    inside the actions of the table with which it is associated, and
    this always updates the counter value associated with the matching
    table entry.
  - For an indexed counter, you may invoke its `count` method
    anywhere in the P4 program where extern object method invocations
    are permitted (e.g. inside actions, or directly inside a control's
    `apply` block), and every such invocation must specify the index
    of the counter value to be updated.

Counters are only intended to support packet counters and byte
counters, or a combination of both called `PACKETS_AND_BYTES`.  The
byte counts are always increased by some measure of the packet length,
where the packet length used might vary from one PSA implementation to
another.  For example, one implementation might use the Ethernet frame
length, including the Ethernet header and FCS bytes, as the packet
arrived on a physical port.  Another might not include the FCS bytes
in its definition of the packet length.  Another might only include
the Ethernet payload length.  Each PSA implementation should document
how it determines the packet length used for byte counter updates.

If you wish to keep counts of other quantities, or to have more
precise control over the packet length used in a byte counter, you may
use Registers to achieve that (Section [#sec-registers]).


### Counter types

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:CounterType_defn]
```

### Counter

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Counter_extern]
```

See section [#appendix-counter-implementation] for pseudocode of an
example implementation of the Counter extern.

PSA implementations must not update any counter values if an indexed
counter is updated with an index that is too large.  It is recommended
that they count such erroneous attempted updates, and record other
information that can help an P4 programmer debug such errors.


### Direct Counter {#sec-direct-counter}

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:DirectCounter_extern]
```

A `DirectCounter` instance must appear as the value of the
`psa_direct_counter` table attribute for at most one table.  We call
this table the `DirectCounter` instance's "owner".  It is an error to
call the `count` method for a `DirectCounter` instance anywhere except
inside an action of its owner table.

The counter value updated by an invocation of `count` is always the
one associated with the table entry that matched.

An action of an owner table need not have `count` method calls for all
of the `DirectCounter` instances that the table owns.  You must use an
explicit `count()` method call on a `DirectCounter` to update it,
otherwise its state will not change.

An example implementation for the `DirectCounter` extern is
essentially the same as the one for `Counter`.  Since there is no
`index` parameter to the `count` method, there is no need to check for
whether it is in range.

The rules here mean that an action that calls `count` on a
`DirectCounter` instance may only be an action of that instance's one
owner table.  If you want to have a single action `A` that can be
invoked by multiple tables, you can still do so by having a unique
action for each such table with a `DirectCounter`, where each such
action in turn calls action `A`, in addition to any `count`
invocations they have.

A `DirectCounter` instance must have a counter value associated with
its owner table that is updated when there is a default action
assigned to the table, and a search of the table results in a miss.
If there is no default action assigned to the table, then there need
not be any counter updated when a search of the table results in a
miss.

By "a default action is assigned to a table", we mean that either the
table has a `default_action` table property with an action assigned to
it in the P4 program, or the control plane has made an explicit call
to assign the table a default action.  If neither of these is true,
then there is no default action assigned to the table.

### Example program using counters

The following partial P4 program demonstrates the instantiation and
updating of `Counter` and `DirectCounter` externs.

## Meters {#sec-meters}

Meters (RFC 2698) are a more complex mechanism for keeping statistics
about packets, most often used for dropping
or "marking" packets that exceed an average packet or bit rate.  To
mark a packet means to change one or more of its quality of service
values in packet headers such as the 802.1Q PCP (priority code point)
or DSCP (differentiated service code point) bits within the IPv4 or
IPv6 type of service byte.  The meters specified in the PSA are
3-color meters.

PSA meters do not require any particular drop or marking actions, nor
do they automatically implement those behaviors for you.  Meters keep
enough state, and update their state during `execute()` method calls,
in such a way that they return a `GREEN` (also known as conform),
`YELLOW` (exceed), or `RED` (violate) result.  See RFC 2698 for details on the
conditions under which one of these three results is returned.  The P4
program is responsible for examining that returned result, and making
changes to packet forwarding behavior as a result.
The value returned by an uninitialized meter shall be GREEN. This is in
accordance with the P4 Runtime specification.


RFC 2698 describes "color aware" and "color blind" variations of
meters.  The `Meter` and `DirectMeter` externs implement both.  The
only difference is in which `execute` method you use when updating
them.  See the comments on the `extern` definitions below.

Similar to counters, there are two flavors of meters: indexed and
direct.  (Indexed) meters are addressed by index, while direct meters
always update a meter state corresponding to the matched table entry
or action, and from the control plane API are addressed using
P4 Runtime table entry as key.

There are many other similarities between counters and meters,
including:

- The number of independently updatable meter values.
- Where meter updates are allowed in a P4 program.
- For `BYTES` type meters, the packet length used in the update is
  determined by the PSA implementation, and can vary from one PSA
  implementation to another.

Further similarities between direct counters and direct meters
include:

- `DirectMeter` `execute` method calls must be performed within
  actions invoked by the table that owns the `DirectMeter` instance.
  It is optional for such an action to call the `execute` method.
- There must be a meter state associated with a `DirectMeter`
  instance's owner table, that can be updated when the table result is
  a miss.  As for a `DirectCounter`, this state only needs to exist if
  a default action is assigned to the table.

The table attribute to specify that a table owns a `DirectMeter`
instance is `psa_direct_meter`.  The value of this table attribute is
a `DirectMeter` instance name.

As for counters, if you call the `execute(idx)` method on an indexed
meter and `idx` is at least the number of meter states, so `idx` is
out of range, no meter state is updated.  The `execute` call still
returns a value of type `PSA_MeterColor_t`, but the value is undefined --
programs that wish to have predictable behavior across implementations
must not use the undefined value in a way that affects the output
packet or other side effects.  The example code below shows one way to
achieve predictable behavior.  Note that this undefined behavior
cannot occur if the value of `n_meters` of an indexed meter is $2^W$,
and the type `S` used to construct the meter is `bit<W>`, since the
index value could never be out of range.

```
#define METER1_SIZE 100
Meter<bit<7>>(METER1_SIZE, PSA_MeterType_t.BYTES) meter1;
bit<7> idx;
PSA_MeterColor_t color1;

// ... later ...

if (idx < METER1_SIZE) {
    color1 = meter1.execute(idx, PSA_MeterColor_t.GREEN);
} else {
    // If idx is out of range, use a default value for color1.  One
    // may also choose to store an error flag in some metadata field.
    color1 = PSA_MeterColor_t.RED;
}
```

Any implementation will have a finite range that can be specified for
the Peak Burst Size and Committed Burst Size.  An implementation
should document the maximum burst sizes they support, and if the
implementation internally truncates the values that the control plane
requests to something more coarse than any number of bytes, that
should also be documented.  It is recommended that the maximum burst
sizes be allowed as large as the number of bytes that can be
transmitted across the implementation's maximum speed port in 100
milliseconds.

Implementations will also have finite ranges and precisions that they
support for the Peak Information Rate and Committed Information Rate.
An implementation should document the maximum rate it supports, as
well as the precision it supports for implementing requested rates.
It is recommended that the maximum rate supported be at least the rate
of the implementation's fastest port, and that the actual implemented
rate should always be within plus or minus 0.1% of the requested rate.

## Registers {#sec-registers}

Registers are stateful memories whose values can be read and written
during packet forwarding under the control of the P4 program.  They
are similar to counters and meters in that their state can be modified
as a result of processing packets, but they are far more general in
the behavior they can implement.

Although you may not use register contents directly in table match
keys, you may use the `read()` method call on the right-hand side of
an assignment statement, which retrieves the current value of the
register.  You may copy the register value into metadata, and it is
then available for matching in subsequent tables.

There are two different constructors for Register instances.  The
value returned for the uninitialized variant is undefined.  The value
returned for the initialized variant is the one specified by the
`initial_value` parameter of the constructor.

A simple usage example is to verify that a "first packet" was
seen for a particular type of flow.  A register cell would be
allocated to the flow, initialized to "clear".  When the protocol
signaled a "first packet", the table would match on this value and
update the flow's cell to "marked".  Subsequent packets in the flow
could would be mapped to the same cell; the current cell value would
be stored in metadata for the packet and a subsequent table could
check that the flow was marked as active.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Register_extern]
```

Another example using registers is given below.  It implements a
packet and byte counter, where the byte counter can be updated by a
packet length specified in the P4 program, rather than one chosen by
the PSA implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-register2.p4:Register_Example2_Part1]

[INCLUDE=examples/psa-example-register2.p4:Register_Example2_Part2]
```

Note the use of the `@atomic` annotation in the block enclosing the
`read()` and `write()` method calls on the `Register` instance.  It is
expected to be common that register accesses will need the `@atomic`
annotation around portions of your program in order to behave as you
desire.  As stated in the P4~16~ specification, without the `@atomic`
annotation in this example, an implementation is allowed to process
two packets `P1` and `P2` in parallel, and perform the register access
operations in this order:

```
    // Possible order of operations for the example program if the
    // @atomic annotation is _not_ used.

    tmp = port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.read(istd.ingress_port);  // for packet P1
    tmp = port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.read(istd.ingress_port);  // for packet P2

    // At this time, if P1 and P2 came from the same ingress_port,
    // each of their values of tmp are identical.

    update_pkt_ip_byte_count(tmp, hdr.ipv4.totalLen);    // for packet P1
    update_pkt_ip_byte_count(tmp, hdr.ipv4.totalLen);    // for packet P2

    port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.write(istd.ingress_port, tmp);  // for packet P1
    port_pkt_ip_bytes_in.write(istd.ingress_port, tmp);  // for packet P2
    // The write() from packet P1 is lost.
```

Since different implementations may have different upper limits on the
complexity of code that they will accept within an `@atomic` block, we
recommend you keep them as small as possible, subject to maintaining
your desired correct behavior.

Individual counter and meter method calls need not be enclosed in
`@atomic` blocks to be safe -- they guarantee atomic behavior of their
individual method calls, without losing any updates.  Even though the
P4~16~ v1.0.0 language specification currently requires that every
`action` of a table behave as if its entire body is annotated by an
`@atomic` annotation, it is recommended to explicitly use `@atomic`
annotations inside of action bodies as if this were not the case,
since (a) it is harmless, and more importantly (b) this requirement
may be removed in a near future revision of the language
specification.

As for indexed counters and meters, access to an index of a register
that is at least the size of the register is out of bounds.  An out of
bounds write has no effect on the state of the system.  An out of
bounds read returns an undefined value.  See the example in Section
[#sec-meters] for one way to write code to guarantee avoiding this
undefined behavior.  Out of bounds register accesses are impossible
for a register instance with type `S` declared as `bit<W>` and size
$2^W$ entries.


## Random

The `Random` extern provides generation of pseudo-random numbers in a
specified range with a uniform distribution.  If one wishes to
generate numbers with a non-uniform distribution, you may do so by
first generating a uniformly distributed random value, and then using
appropriate table lookups and/or arithmetic on the resulting value to
achieve the desired distribution.

An implementation is not required to produce cryptographically strong
pseudo-random number generation.  For example, a particularly
inexpensive implementation might use a linear feedback shift register
to generate values.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:Random_extern]
```


## Action Profile {#sec-action-profile}

Action profiles are used as table implementation attributes.

Action profiles provide a mechanism to populate table entries
with action specifications that have been defined outside the table entry
specification. An action profile extern can be instantiated as
a resource in the P4 program. A table that uses this action profile
must specify its `psa_implementation` attribute as the action profile
instance.

~ Figure {#fig-ap; caption: "Action profiles in PSA"; page-align: here;}
![ap]
~
[ap]: figs/action_profile.png { width: 75%;}

Figure [#fig-ap] contrasts a direct table with a table that has an action
profile implementation. A direct table, as seen in Figure [#fig-ap] (a) contains
the action specification in each table entry. In this example, the table has a
match key consisting of an LPM on header field `h.f`. The action is to set the
port. As we can see, entries t1 and t3 have the same action, i.e. to set the
port to 1. Action profiles enable sharing an action across multiple entries by
using a separate table as shown in Figure [#fig-ap] (b).

A table with an action profile implementation has entries that point to a member
reference instead of directly defining an action specification. A mapping from
member references to action specifications is maintained in a separate table
that is part of the action profile instance defined in the table `psa_implementation`
attribute. When a table with an action profile implementation is applied, the
member reference is resolved and the corresponding action specification is
applied to the packet.

Action profile members may only specify action types defined in the `actions`
attribute of the implemented table. An action profile instance may be shared
across multiple tables only if all such tables define the same set of actions
in their `actions` attribute. Tables with an action profile implementation
cannot define a default action. The default action for such tables is implicitly
set to `NoAction`.

The control plane can add, modify or delete member entries for a
given action profile instance. The controller-assigned member reference
must be unique in the scope of the action profile instance. An
action profile instance may hold at most `size` entries as defined in the
constructor parameter. Table entries must specify the action using the
controller-assigned reference for the desired member entry. Directly specifying
the action as part of the table entry is not allowed for tables with an
action profile implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:ActionProfile_extern]
```

### Action Profile Example
The P4 control block `Ctrl` in the example below instantiates an
action profile `ap` that can contain at most 128 member entries. Table
`indirect` uses this instance by specifying the `psa_implementation` attribute.
The control plane can add member entries to `ap`, where each member can
specify either a `foo` or `NoAction` action. Table entries for `indirect`
table must specify the action using the controller-assigned member reference.

```
control Ctrl(inout H hdr, inout M meta) {

  action foo() { meta.foo = 1; }

  ActionProfile(128) ap;

  table indirect {
    key = {hdr.ipv4.dst_address: exact;}
    actions = { foo; NoAction; }
    psa_implementation = ap;
  }

  apply {
    indirect.apply();
  }
}
```


## Action Selector {#sec-action-selector}

Action selectors are used as table implementation attributes.

Action selectors implement yet another mechanism to populate table
entries with action specifications that have been defined outside the
table entry. They are more powerful than action profiles because they also
provide the ability to dynamically select the action specification to apply
upon matching a table entry. An action selector extern can be instantiated as
a resource in the P4 program, similar to action profiles. Furthermore,
a table that uses this action selector must specify its `psa_implementation` attribute
as the action selector instance.

~ Figure {#fig-as; caption: "Action selectors in PSA"; page-align: here;}
![as]
~
[as]: figs/action_selector.png { width: 90%;}

Figure [#fig-as] illustrates a table that has an action selector implementation.
In this example, the table has a match key consisting of an LPM on header field
`h.f`. A second match type `selector` is used to define the fields that are
used to look up the action specification from the selector at runtime.

A table with an action action selector implementation consists of entries that
point to either an action profile member reference or an action profile group
reference. An action selector instance can be logically visualized as two tables
as shown in Figure [#fig-as]. The first table contains a mapping from group
references to a set of member references. The second table contains a mapping
from member references to action specifications.

When a packet matches a table entry at runtime, the controller-assigned
reference of the action profile member or group is read. If the entry points to
a member then the corresponding action specification is applied to the packet.
However, if the entry points to a group, a dynamic selection algorithm is used
to select a member from the group, and the action specification
corresponding to that member is applied. The dynamic selection algorithm is
specified as a parameter when instantiating the action selector.

Action selector members may only specify action types defined in the
`actions` attribute of the implemented table.

Minimum requirements for a PSA implementation of action selectors:

+ Support non-empty groups where every action in the same group has
  the same action name.
+ Within the same group, support arbitrary action parameter values
  among different members of the group.
+ Support different action names in different groups.
+ No predictable data plane behavior is required if a table entry is
  matched that points at an empty group.

Optional extensions:

+ Support non-empty groups where in the same group, different actions
  can have different action names, as well as arbitrary action
  parameter values.
+ Support table entries that point at an empty group.  When the entry
  is matched, execute the action assigned to the table property
  `psa_empty_group_action`.

The `psa_empty_group_action` property of a table is similar to the
`default_action` property in the following ways:

+ They both have actions as their values.
+ The P4 source code specifies the initial value.
+ If the table property `psa_empty_group_action` is not given in the
  P4 source code, its value is `NoAction()`.
+ They may have a `const` modifier, indicating that control software
  is not allowed to change this action.
+ In the absence of a `const` modifier, the control software is
  allowed to change the action assigned to `psa_empty_group_action`.

PSA implementers should note that supporting empty groups with
predictable data plane behavior may be required in a future version of
PSA.  In some cases, it may be possible for the combination of a PSA
data plane plus its P4Runtime server software to achieve this desired
behavior, as far as the P4Runtime client controller software can
observe.  See Appendix [#appendix-empty-action-selector-groups].

An action selector instance may be shared across multiple tables only if all such
tables define the same set of actions in their `actions` attribute. Furthermore,
the selector match fields for such tables must be identical and must be specified
in the same order across all tables sharing the selector. Tables with an action
selector implementation cannot define a default action. The default action for
such tables is implicitly set to `NoAction`.

The dynamic selection algorithm requires a field list as an input for generating
the index to a member entry in a group. This field list is created by using the
match type `selector` when defining the table match key. The match fields of
type `selector` are composed into a field list in the order they are specified.
The composed field list is passed as an input to the action selector
implementation. It is illegal to define a `selector` type match field if the
table does not have an action selector implementation.

The control plane can add, modify or delete member and group entries for a
given action selector instance. An action selector instance may hold at most
`size` member entries as defined in the constructor parameter. The number of
groups may be at most the size of the table that is implemented by the selector.
Table entries must specify the action using a reference to the desired member
or group entry. Directly specifying the action as part of the table entry is not
allowed for tables with an action selector implementation.

```
[INCLUDE=psa.p4:ActionSelector_extern]
```
### Action Selector Example
The P4 control block `Ctrl` in the example below instantiates an
action selector `as` that can contain at most 128 member entries. The
action selector uses a crc16 algorithm with output width of 10 bits
to select a member entry within a group.

Table `indirect_with_selection` uses this instance by specifying the
`psa_implementation` table property as shown. The control plane can add member and group
entries to `as`. Each member can specify either a `foo` or `NoAction` action.
When programming the table entries, the control plane *does not* include the
fields of match type `selector` in the match key. The selector match fields are
instead used to compose a list that is passed to the action selector instance.
In the example below, the list {hdr.ipv4.src_address, hdr.ipv4.protocol} is
passed as input to the crc16 hash algorithm used for dynamic member selection
by action selector `as`.

```
control Ctrl(inout H hdr, inout M meta) {

  action foo() { meta.foo = 1; }

  ActionSelector(PSA_HashAlgorithm_t.CRC16, 128, 10) as;

  table indirect_with_selection {
    key = {
      hdr.ipv4.dst_address: exact;
      hdr.ipv4.src_address: selector;
      hdr.ipv4.protocol: selector;
    }
    actions = { foo; NoAction; }
    psa_implementation = as;
  }

  apply {
    indirect_with_selection.apply();
  }
}
```

Note that the management of action selector entries in the presence of
link failures is outside the scope of the PSA. Fast-failover requires
information from the control plane and will be addressed as part of the P4
Runtime API[^P4RuntimeAPI] working group.

[^P4RuntimeAPI]: The P4 Runtime API is defined as a Google Protocol
    Buffer `.proto` file and an accompanying English specification document
    here:
    <https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime>


## Timestamps

A PSA implementation provides an `ingress_timestamp` value for every
packet in the `Ingress` control block, as a field in the struct with
type `psa_ingress_input_metadata_t`.  This timestamp should be close
to the time that the first bit of the packet arrived to the device, or
alternately, to the time that the device began parsing the packet.
This timestamp is _not_ automatically included with the packet in the
`Egress` control block.  A P4 program wishing to use the value of
`ingress_timestamp` in egress code must copy it to a user-defined
metadata field that reaches egress.

A PSA implementation also provides an `egress_timestamp` value for
every packet in the `Egress` control block, as a field of the struct
with type `psa_egress_input_metadata_t`.

One expected use case for timestamps is to store them in tables or
`Register` instances to implement checking for timeout events for
protocols, where precision on the order of milliseconds is sufficient
for most protocols.

Another expected use case is INT (In-band Network Telemetry[^INT]),
where precision on the order of microseconds or smaller is necessary
to measure queueing latencies that differ by those amounts.  It takes
only 0.74 microseconds to transmit a 9 Kbyte Ethernet jumbo frame on a
100 gigabit per second link.

[^INT]: <http://p4.org/p4/inband-network-telemetry>

For these applications, it is recommended that an implementation's
timestamp increments at least once every microsecond.  Incrementing
once per clock cycle in an ASIC or FPGA implementation would be a
reasonable choice.  The timestamp should increment at a constant rate
over time.  For example, it should not be a simple count of clock
cycles in a device that implements dynamic frequency
scaling[^DynamicFrequencyScaling].

[^DynamicFrequencyScaling]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling>

Timestamps are of type `Timestamp_t`, which is type `bit<W>` for a
value of `W` defined by the implementation.  Timestamps are expected
to wrap around during the normal passage of time.  It is recommended
that an implementation pick a rate of advance and a bit width such
that wrapping around occurs at most once every hour.  Making the wrap
time this long (or longer) makes timestamps more useful for several
use cases.

- Checking for timeouts of protocol hello / keep-alive traffic that is
  on the order of seconds or minutes.
- If timestamps are placed into packets without converting them to
  other formats, then external data analysis systems using those
  timestamps will in many cases need to do so, e.g. to compare
  timestamps stored in packets by different PSA devices.  These
  systems will need different formulas and/or parameters to perform
  this conversion for each wrap period, or to add extra external time
  references to the recorded data.  The extra data required for
  accurate conversion is lower, and the likelihood of conversion
  mistakes is lower, if the timestamp values wrap less often.
- If timestamps are converted to other formats within a P4 program, it
  will need access to parameters that are likely to change every wrap
  time, e.g. at least a "base value" to add some calculated value to.
  A straightforward way to do this requires the control plane to
  update these values at least once or twice per timestamp wrap time.
- Programs that wish to use `(egress_timestamp - ingress_timestamp)`
  to calculate the queueing latency experienced by a packet need the
  wrap time to exceed the maximum queueing latency.

Examples of the number of bits required for wrap times of at least one
hour:

- A 32-bit timestamp advancing by 1 per microsecond takes 1.19 hours
  to wrap.
- A 42-bit timestamp advancing by 1 per nanosecond takes 1.22 hours to
  wrap.

A PSA implementation is not required to implement time
synchronization, e.g. via PTP[^PTP] or NTP[^NTP].

[^PTP]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol>
[^NTP]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>

The control plane API excerpt below is intended to be added as part of
the P4 Runtime API.

```
// The TimestampInfo and Timestamp messages should be added to the
// "oneof" inside of message "Entity".

// TimestampInfo is only intended to be read.  Attempts to update this
// entity have no effect, and should return an error status that the
// entity is read only.

message TimestampInfo {
  // The number of bits in the device's `Timestamp_t` type.
  uint32 size_in_bits = 1;
  // The timestamp value of this device increments
  // `increments_per_period` times every `period_in_seconds` seconds.
  uint64 increments_per_period = 2;
  uint64 period_in_seconds = 3;
}

// The timestamp value can be read or written.  Note that if there are
// already timestamp values stored in tables or `Register` instances,
// they will not be updated as a result of writing this timestamp
// value.  Writing the device timestamp is intended only for
// initialization and testing.

message Timestamp {
  bytes value = 1;
}
```

For every packet `P` that is processed by ingress and then egress,
with the minimum possible latency in the packet buffer, it is
guaranteed that the `egress_timestamp` value for that packet will be
the same as, or slightly larger than, the `ingress_timestamp` value
that the packet was assigned on ingress.  By "slightly larger than",
we mean that the difference `(egress_timestamp - ingress_timestamp)`
should be a reasonably accurate estimate of this minimum possible
latency through the packet buffer, perhaps truncated down to 0 if
timestamps advance more slowly than this minimum latency.

Consider two packets such that at the same time (e.g. the same clock
cycle), one is assigned its value of `ingress_timestamp` near the time
it begins parsing, and the other is assigned its value of
`egress_timestamp` near the time that it begins its egress processing.
It is allowed that these timestamps differ by a few tens of
nanoseconds (or by one "tick" of the timestamp, if one tick is larger
than that time), due to practical difficulties in making them always
equal.

Recall that the binary operators `+` and `-` on the `bit<W>` type in
P4 are defined to perform wrap-around unsigned arithmetic.  Thus even
if a timestamp value wraps around from its maximum value back to 0,
you can always calculate the number of ticks that have elapsed from
timestamp $t1$ until timestamp $t2$ using the expression $(t2 - t1)$
(if more than $2^W$ ticks have elapsed, there will be aliasing of the
result).  For example, if timestamps were $W >= 4$ bits in size,
$t1=2^{W}-5$, and $t2=3$, then $(t2-t1)=8$.  There is thus no need for
conditional execution to calculate such elapsed times.

It is sometimes useful to minimize storage costs by discarding some
bits of a timestamp value in a P4 program for use cases that do not
need the full wrap time or precision.  For example, an application
that only needs to detect protocol timeouts with an accuracy of 1
second can discard the least significant bits of a timestamp that
change more often than every 1 second.

Another example is an application that needed full precision of the
least significant bits of a timestamp, but the combination of the
control plane and P4 program are designed to examine all entries of a
`Register` array where these partial timestamps are stored more often
than once every 5 seconds, to prevent wrapping.  In that case, the P4
program could discard the most significant bits of the timestamp so
that the remaining bits wrap every 8 seconds, and store those partial
timestamps in the `Register` instance.


## Packet Digest {#sec-packet-digest}

A digest is one mechanism to send a message from the data plane to the
control plane.  Another is to send a packet to the control plane via
the port numbered `PSA_PORT_CPU`.  Sending a packet to port
`PSA_PORT_CPU` typically sends most or all of the original packet
headers, and perhaps also the payload, each as a separate message to
be received and processed by the control plane.  The contents of a
digest for one packet are typically much smaller than the packet.  A
PSA implementation can take advantage of this, e.g. it might combine
digests for multiple packets into larger messages, to reduce the
rate of messages sent to the control plane.

A digest message may contain any values from the data plane.  Because
a P4 program may have multiple Digest instances, each with different
message contents, the PSA implementation as a whole must provide the
ability to distinguish the messages created by different Digest
instances from each other.

In PSA, a digest is created by calling the `pack` method on the digest
instance.  The argument is the value to be included in the digest,
often a collection of values in a P4 `struct` type.  The compiler
decides the best serialization format to send the digest contents to a
local software agent, which is responsible for sending the digest data
in a form defined by the P4 Runtime API specification.

A PSA program can instantiate multiple Digest instances in the same
IngressDeparser control block, and make at most one `pack` call on
each instance during a single execution of this control block.
A PSA implementation need not support the use of the Digest
extern in the EgressDeparser control block.

There is no requirement that if multiple Digest messages are created
while processing the same packet, that these messages must be "bundled
together" in any way.  An implementation is free to put them in
separate queues per Digest instance, for example, and they may arrive
to the controller completely separate from each other, and in a
different order than they were generated.  It is recommended that a
PSA implementation send Digest messages _from a single Digest
instance_ to the control plane in the order they were generated.

If you wish to associate multiple Digest messages from different
instances with each other in control plane software, it may suit your
purposes to include a common sequence number or timestamp in all
Digest messages generated by the same packet.  Then use those in the
control plane for correlation of different messages.

Since high speed PSA implementations are expected to be able to
generate digests much faster than control software can consume them,
it is expected that loss of such digest messages will occur if the
data plane generates them too quickly.  It is recommended that PSA
implementations maintain a count of digest messages that the data
plane creates, but do not reach the control plane, independently for
each digest instance.

```

```

Below is a part of an example program that demonstrates using a digest
to notify the control plane about source Ethernet MAC addresses and
ingress ports of packets that have not been seen before.

# Atomicity of control plane API operations {#sec-atomicity-of-control-plane-api-operations}

All table add, delete, and modify operations must be atomic relative
to packet forwarding.  That is, for every table `apply` operation, and
every control plane operation on a table that adds, deletes, or
modifies one table entry, the `apply` operation should behave as if
that control plane operation has not yet occurred, or as if the
control plane operation is complete.  The P4 program should never
behave as if the control plane operation is partially complete.

Note that this requirement is for every table `apply` operation
individually.  A PSA implementation is not required to support
performing multiply `apply` operations on the same table in the same
invocation of a control block.  If it does support that, it is allowed
that a control plane update _may_ occur after one `apply` call by a
packet to a table, but before the next `apply` call by the same
packet.

A PSA implementation should give an error and fail to compile P4
programs for which it cannot meet this atomicity requirement.  For
example, perhaps the implementation can only satisfy this requirement
for tables with actions having at most 128 bits of action parameters,
and thus gives an error if you attempt to compile a P4 program that
contains an action with more bits of parameters.

For example, suppose a table `T` has an action `A` with 100 total bits
of action parameters, and the control plane has added a table entry
with a search key `K` and action `A`.  Later the control plane
performs an update operation on the entry with key `K` that leaves the
key `K` the same, but changes the 100 bits of action parameters.
Every packet doing an `apply` on table `T` and matching the entry with
key `K` should execute action `A` with either the old 100 bits of
action parameters, or the new 100 bits of action parameters.

The P4 Runtime API enables controllers to create "batch" messages that perform
more than one single operation, as defined here.  If so, a PSA
implementation need only ensure that each single operation is atomic.
There is no requirement that a sequence of _multiple_ table entry add,
delete, or update operations should be atomic.

The same applies for all control plane API operations on externs,
unless the control plane operation explicitly documents otherwise.

In particular, ActionProfile and ActionSelector single operations,
such as adding a member to a group, removing a member from a group,
adding an empty group, deleting an empty group, or modifying the
action parameters of an action added earlier to a group, should all be
atomic.

Also, a control plane read, or write, of a single element of a
Register array should be atomic, and behave as if it occurred before
or after (but not during) any P4 program's section of code labeled
with the `@atomic` annotation.  There is _no_ control plane operation
on a Register that can atomically read an element, then write back a
modified value.

Advice for P4 developers: If you desire a capability for the control
plane to atomically read, modify, then write back a Register array
element, you should write your P4 program such that the desired read,
modify, and write operation can be done by a packet that your control
plane can inject into the data plane, e.g. via packet in / packet out
P4 Runtime API operations.

A high speed PSA implementation might process hundreds or thousands of
packets between each single control plane operation.  There are common
"write tables from later to earlier in the data flow", sometimes also
called "back to front" or "pointer flipping", techniques used by
existing control planes to achieve an effect that is similar to making
a sequence of many table entry operations atomic relative to packet
forwarding.  Recent research analyzes these techniques in a more
general setting[^Cernyetal2016].

# Appendix: Open Issues {@h1:"A"}

As with any work in progress, we have a number of open issues that are under discussion in the
working group. In addition to the TBDs in the document, there a number of larger issues that are
summarized here:

## Action Selectors

The size parameter in the action_selector instance that defines the maximum number of members in a
selector. In some cases it might be useful to allow the controller to dynamically provision
resources on the selector or to utilize different selector sizes on different targets, while using
a common P4 program.

We also need to formalize the interaction of action profiles and action selectors with counters and
meters.

## Observation and control of congestion

The current PSA does not provide any mechanisms to observe if
particular output ports or queues are leading to congestion in the
packet buffer.  Thus it is not possible without using mechanisms
defined outside of PSA to implement a feature like Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN)[^ECN].  One possibility here is to define a small
field, perhaps only 1 bit, that is part of the metadata associated
with each packet as it begins egress processing.  This field would
indicate "how much congestion" the packet experienced in the packet
buffer.

[^ECN]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification>

There is also currently no way defined in PSA for ingress P4 code to
send information about a packet to the packet buffer that might
influence the behavior of a congestion control algorithm, such as
Approximate Fair Drop (AFD).  This is partly because of the variety of
congestion control mechanisms in use by switches today.

It would be desirable to define in PSA a small set of fields about a
packet that would be useful inputs to multiple congestion control
algorithms.  One possibility is a hash of the packet's "flow id",
often implemented as a hash of packet header fields like IP source and
destination address, IP protocol, and optionally TCP/UDP source and
destination ports.  Given that P4 programmable devices can implement
network protocols other than IP, including custom ones, a more general
mechanism is desirable in PSA devices.


## Enabling full implementation of In-band Network Telemetry

One promising use case for P4 programmable network devices is to
implement In-band Network Telemetry[^INT].  While PSA mechanisms such
as timestamps enable a significant portion of INT features to be
implemented, they do not yet define any mechanisms to access
information such as egress port link utilization or queue
occupancy[^PSA_INT_Issue].

[^PSA_INT_Issue]: <https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec/issues/510>


## PSA profiles

We are considering whether to specify different limits that a certain PSA implementation has to have in order for the implementation to be considered compliant. The main point of PSA is to enable a variety of devices, and thus limits may be artificial. On the other hand, for most interesting applications, it is necessary to support a minimum of functionality.

# Appendix: Implementation of the InternetChecksum extern {#appendix-internetchecksum-implementation}

Besides RFC 1461, RFC 1071 and RFC 1141 also contain useful tips on
efficiently computing the Internet checksum, especially in software
implementations.

Here we give reference implementations for the methods of the
`InternetChecksum` extern, specified with the syntax and semantics of
P4~16~, with extensions of a `for` loop and a `return` statement for
returning a value from a function.

The minimum internal state necessary for one instance of an
`InternetChecksum` object is a 16-bit bit vector, here called `sum`.

```
// This is one way to perform a normal one's complement sum of two
// 16-bit values.
bit<16> ones_complement_sum(in bit<16> x, in bit<16> y) {
    bit<17> ret = (bit<17>) x + (bit<17>) y;
    if (ret[16:16] == 1) {
        ret = ret + 1;
    }
    return ret[15:0];
}

bit<16> sum;

void clear() {
    sum = 0;
}

// Restriction: data is a multiple of 16 bits long
void add<T>(in T data) {
    bit<16> d;
    for (each 16-bit aligned piece d of data) {
        sum = ones_complement_sum(sum, d);
    }
}

// Restriction: data is a multiple of 16 bits long
void subtract<T>(in T data) {
    bit<16> d;
    for (each 16-bit aligned piece d of data) {
        // ~d is the negative of d in one's complement arithmetic.
        sum = ones_complement_sum(sum, ~d);
    }
}

// The Internet checksum is the one's complement _of_ the one's
// complement sum of the relevant parts of the packet.  The methods
// above calculate the one's complement sum of the parts in the
// variable 'sum'.  get() returns the bitwise negation of 'sum', which
// is the one's complement of 'sum'.

bit<16> get() {
    return ~sum;
}

bit<16> get_state() {
    return sum;
}

void set_state(bit<16> checksum_state) {
    sum = checksum_state;
}
```


# Appendix: Example implementation of Counter extern {#appendix-counter-implementation}

The example implementation below, in particular the function
`next_counter_value`, is not intended to restrict PSA implementations.
The storage format for `PACKETS_AND_BYTES` type counters demonstrated
there is one example of how it could be done.  Implementations are
free to store state in other ways, as long as the control plane API
returns the correct packet and byte count values.

Two common techniques for counter implementations in the data plane are:

- wrap around counters
- saturating counters, that 'stick' at their maximum possible value,
  without wrapping around.

This specification does not mandate any particular approach in the
data plane.  Implementations should strive to avoid losing information
in counters.  One common implementation technique is to implement an
atomic "read and clear" operation in the data plane that can be
invoked by the control plane software.  The control plane software
invokes this operation frequently enough to prevent counters from ever
wrapping or saturating, and adds the values read to larger counters in
driver memory.

```
Counter(bit<32> n_counters, PSA_CounterType_t type) {
    this.num_counters = n_counters;
    this.counter_vals = new array of size n_counters, each element with type W;
    this.type = type;
    if (this.type == PSA_CounterType_t.PACKETS_AND_BYTES) {
        // Packet and byte counts share storage in the same counter
        // state.  Should we have a separate constructor with an
        // additional argument indicating how many of the bits to use
        // for the byte counter?
        W shift_amount = TBD;
        this.shifted_packet_count = ((W) 1) << shift_amount;
        this.packet_count_mask = (~((W) 0)) << shift_amount;
        this.byte_count_mask = ~this.packet_count_mask;
    }
}

W next_counter_value(W cur_value, PSA_CounterType_t type) {
    if (type == PSA_CounterType_t.PACKETS) {
        return (cur_value + 1);
    }
    // Exactly which packet bytes are included in packet_len is
    // implementation-specific.
    PacketLength_t packet_len = <packet length in bytes>;
    if (type == PSA_CounterType_t.BYTES) {
        return (cur_value + packet_len);
    }
    // type must be PSA_CounterType_t.PACKETS_AND_BYTES
    // In type W, the least significant bits contain the byte
    // count, and most significant bits contain the packet count.
    // This is merely one example storage format.  Implementations
    // are free to store packets_and_byte state in other ways, as
    // long as the control plane API returns the correct separate
    // packet and byte count values.
    W next_packet_count = ((cur_value + this.shifted_packet_count) &
                           this.packet_count_mask);
    W next_byte_count = (cur_value + packet_len) & this.byte_count_mask;
    return (next_packet_count | next_byte_count);
}

void count(in S index) {
    if (index < this.num_counters) {
        this.counter_vals[index] = next_counter_value(this.counter_vals[index],
                                                      this.type);
    } else {
        // No counter_vals updated if index is out of range.
        // See below for optional debug information to record.
    }
}
```

Optional debugging information that may be kept if an `index` value is
out of range includes:

- Number of times this occurs.
- A FIFO of the first N out-of-range index values that occur, where N
  is implementation-defined (e.g. it might only be 1).  Extra
  information to identify which `count()` method call in the P4
  program had the out-of-range `index` value is also recommended.


# Appendix: Rationale for design {#appendix-rationale}

## Why egress processing? {#appendix-rationale-egress}

Question: Why is it useful to have separate ingress vs. egress
processing in a switch device?

There have been packet processing ASICs built that effectively only do
'ingress' processing, then go to a packet buffer with one or more
queues, and then go out of the device, effectively being restricted to
no or "empty" egress processing.

There are a few things that are trickier to do in such a device.


1. Last-nanosecond changes to the packet

If you want to measure the queuing latency through the device, and put
a measurement of this quantity inside the packet somewhere, it is in
general not possible to know the queueing latency before the packet is
sent to the packet buffer.  There are _special cases_ where you can
predict it, e.g. when there is a single FIFO queue feeding a constant
bit rate output port, with nothing like Ethernet pause flow control.

But if you have variable bit rate links, e.g. because of things like
Ethernet pause flow control, or Wi-Fi signal quality changes, or if
you have multiple class-of-service queues with a scheduling policy
between them like weighted fair queueing, then it is not possible to
predict at the time the packet is enqueued, when it will be dequeued.
The queueing latency depends upon unknown future events, such as
whether Ethernet pause frames will arrive, or how many and what size
of packets arriving in the near future will be put into which class of
service queues for the same output port.

In such cases, having egress processing for taking the measurement,
after it is known and easy to calculate as "dequeue time - enqueue
time", allows the egress processing to modify the packet further.



2. Multicast efficiency and flexibility

It is possible in a PSA device to handle multicast by doing a
recirculate plus clone operation for each of N copies to be made, but
this reduces the processing capacity of ingress that is available to
newly arriving packets, in particular newly arriving packets that you
might consider more important to keep than the multicast packets.

By designing a packet buffer that can take a packet with a 'multicast
group id', which the control plane configures to make copies to a
selected set of output ports, it frees up the part of the system that
performs ingress processing to accept new packets more quickly, and at
a more predictable rate.

There could still be a challenge in designing the packet replication
portion of the system not to fall behind when many multicast packets
to be replicated to many output ports arrive close together in time,
but it is fairly easy to separate the concerns of multicast from
unicast packets.  For example, a device implementer could prioritize
unicast packets so that they are not slowed down if multicast
replication is falling behind.

Once you have multicast designed in this way, there are still
multicast use cases where one needs to process different copies of the
packet differently.  For example, the copy going out port 5 might need
a VLAN tag of 7 placed in its header, whereas the copy going out port
2 might need a VLAN tag of 18 placed in its header.  Similarly for
multicast packets entering one of many flavors of tunnels, e.g. VXLAN,
GRE, etc.  By doing this per-copy modifications in egress processing,
the packet replication logic can be kept very simple -- just make
identical copies of the packet as ingress finished with it, except for
some kind of unique 'id' on each copy that egress processing can use
to distinguish them.


## No output port change during egress {#appendix-rationale-egress-cannot-change-output-port}

Question: Why can't my P4 program change the output port during egress
processing?

In a network device that has many input and output ports, packets can
arrive at or near the same time on multiple input ports, all destined
for the same output port.

Packet buffers are typically designed into such network devices, to
store the packets that cannot be sent out immediately, absorbing this
short term congestion.

For a given output port P, we now wish to retrieve packets from the
packet buffer at a rate that is equal to the rate we will send them to
port P, typically equal to the maximum bit rate that it is possible to
send data out of port P.

Packet scheduling algorithms such as weighted fair queueing, and many
others, have been developed that can determine which among a set of
potentially many FIFO queues that a packet should be read from next,
and sent out on the port.

These link scheduling algorithms are real time algorithms with very
tight timing constraints.  If they go too slow, the output port goes
idle and its capacity is wasted.  If they go too fast, we read packets
from the packet buffer faster than they can be transmitted on the
port, and we are back at the same problem we had originally -- either
drop some of the packets, or store them somewhere again until the port
is ready to transmit them.

Such a scheduling algorithm that handles multiple output ports must
know which output port all packets are destined to, before they are
put into the packet buffer.  If that target output port can be changed
after the packet is read out, then we can simultaneously overload one
output port while starving another.

That is why the `egress_port` of a packet must be selected during
ingress processing, and egress processing is not allowed to change it.

These scheduling algorithms also need to know the size of each packet,
i.e. the size as it will be when transmitted on the port.

It is possible in egress P4 code to drop a packet, or to change the
size of the packet by adding or removing headers.  Very likely
P4-programmable network devices will have their scheduling algorithms
run just slightly faster than the port to handle cases where many
packets in a row are decreased in size during egress processing, and
have tight control loops monitoring the size of packets leaving egress
processing to make small adustments in the rate that the scheduling
algorithm operates for each port.  Either that, or they will just
leave some fraction of the output port's capacity unused during times
when all packet sizes are being decreased.

Certainly if there are long durations of time when egress decides to
drop all packets to an output port, that port will go idle.  The
scheduling algorithm implementations are all built with a finite
maximum packet scheduling rate.


## Ingress deparser and egress parser {#appendix-rationale-ingress-deparser-egress-parser}

Question: P4~14~ did not have an ingress deparser, or an egress
parser.  Why does PSA have these things?

P4~14~ did not have these things explicitly, but there was also not
much _explicitly_ stated in the P4~14~ specification about what data
about each packet was carried from ingress to egress.  Often such
things were left implicit.  Some implementations have an ingress
deparser whose order of emitting headers is auto-generated from the
P4~14~ program's parser code.  This leads to restrictions on your
P4~14~ program, not stated in the P4~14~ specification, that the
contents of your headers and metadata must be in a state where if you
deparse at that point, then your P4~14~ parser code must be able to
parse that packet, or else the device will fail to parse it in the
(implicit) egress parser.

By making the ingress deparser and egress parser explicit, we hope to
make this behavior more defined, and more portable across different
PSA implementations.  We expect that the common case will be that the
ingress and egress parsers will have much (or all) code in common with
each other, and this is easy to do using P4~16~'s capability for one
parser to call another, i.e. you can write a common parser, then call
it from your ingress and egress parsers.

You can also choose to make the two parsers different, and have full
control over the differences between them.  For example, you might
wish your egress parser to handle extra headers that you only put onto
cloned packets, that should never appear on packets from input ports.

Similarly for the ingress deparser.  By making this an explicit and
separate control block, you now have full control over exactly what
data about a packet is included when it is sent to the packet buffer,
and what is not.  In P4~14~, it was implicit that "all packet metadata
used somewhere in egress code" was carried along with each packet.
This can still be done in P4~16~ programs for the PSA, but now you
must be explicit in doing so.  With PSA, you now have a way to
restrict how much data is carried with each packet, which can be
important if the I/O bandwidth of the packet buffer becomes a
bottleneck.


# Appendix: Multi-pipeline PSA devices {#appendix-multi-pipeline-psa-devices}

The highest packet rate network devices today are ASICs running at a
clock rate on the order of 1 to 2 GHz.  This discussion will assume 1
GHz for the sake of a concrete numerical example, but everything
discussed here scales linearly with the clock rate.

It is common to design a portion of a network ASIC such that it can
start processing a new packet once every clock cycle, and finish a
packet every clock cycle.  The latency might be hundreds of clock
cycles from starting a packet until it is complete.  P4 tables in such
ASICs are typically implemented using logic such as TCAMs and SRAMs.
TCAM designs can do 1 search per clock cycle.  The lowest area and
power SRAMs can do 1 read or 1 write per clock cycle.

While there are "multi ported" SRAM designs that can be read and/or
written multiple times per clock cycle, these have a noticeable
increase in area and power over the "single ported" designs that are
limited to 1 access per cycle.  If multi ported TCAM designs even
exist, the cost premium for multi-ported TCAMs is likely to be even
higher than the cost premium for multi-ported SRAMs.  The typical way
to achieve higher TCAM search rates is via parallelism, by creating
multiple copies of the desired TCAM, which is a linear increase in
area and power (at least).

Due to these issues, if one wishes to create a switch ASIC that
achieves a packet processing rate of N times the clock rate, e.g. 2
billion packets per second in a 1 GHz ASIC, the most straightforward
way to do this is to take advantage of the fact that packet processing
is (mostly) an embarrasingly parallel
problem[^EmbarrassinglyParallel], and create a device with N
pipelines[^PipelineNote], each pipeline processing packets at 1
billion packets per second.

[^EmbarrassinglyParallel]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel>

[^PipelineNote]: Here and elsewhere in P4 specification documents, the term "pipeline" refers to a portion of a P4 implementation that implements, for example, the behavior of IngressParser, Ingress, then IngressDeparser in PSA.  This is by now traditional in P4 specifications, and although we will not try to change that here, note that there are other reasonable hardware designs that can accomplish this goal that few would call a pipeline, e.g. a collection of CPU cores running in parallel, each processing different packets.

A PSA device designed in this way would typically have N ingress
pipelines, plus N egress pipelines.  It is common to
assign multiple physical ports of the switch ASIC to each pipeline in
a hard-wired fashion, e.g. a device with 32 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports
might physically hard-wire ports 0 through 15 to pipeline 0, and ports
16 through 31 to pipeline 1.  All packets received on ports 0 through
15 will be processed by ingress pipeline 0, then go to the packet
buffer (if they were not dropped in ingress), then go to egress
pipeline 0 if ingress chose output port 0 through 15, or go to egress
pipeline 1 if ingress chose output port 16 through 31.

In such a device, typically you will want the same P4 program to be
run on every one of these N ingress pipelines, and every one of the N
egress pipelines.

It is physically possible in such a device for the control plane to
install different table entries in the different pipelines, and there
are use cases where this can help achieve higher scale in number of
usable table entries.  For example, perhaps you have an ingress table
with the ingress port as one of the fields in its search key.  If this
is the case, the packet processing behavior is the same even if table
entries for port X are installed only in the ingress pipeline that
processes packets from port X.  Installing that table entry in the
other pipelines would be an unnecessary use of table space, since it
could never be matched.  Whether the device-dependent control software
of such a PSA device enables taking advantage of such space savings is
implementation dependent.

Regardless of this issue, applying tables in P4 is an embarrassingly
parallel activity, because as long as table entries are installed
where they might be matched, pipelines can operate completely
independently of each other with no communication between them (one
small exception is described below).  The same is true for most PSA
externs, e.g. `ActionProfile`, `ActionSelector`, `Checksum`, `Digest`,
`Hash`, and `Random`.  What P4 tables and these externs have in common
is: either the P4 program behavior cannot modify their state at all
(e.g. tables, `ActionProfile`, `ActionSelector`), or can only modify
it in a way that does not affect the processing of other packets
(e.g. `Checksum`, `Digest`, `Hash`).  `Random` is a special case here:
updating the state of a pseudo-random number generator can affect the
processing of other packets, but this is typically not a concern for
the way that pseudo-random numbers are used (e.g. randomly choosing
packets to drop or mark in Random Early Detection).

For counters, there is counter state maintained independently in each
pipeline, but if corresponding counter entries in each pipeline count
"the same thing" (e.g. packets matching a table entry with key X
installed in all pipelines), then it is straightforward to add up the
corresponding counter values from all pipelines.

Consider a device where meter state is maintained independently in
each pipeline.  If you have a multi-pipeline PSA device, and wish to
achieve the effect: "meter all packets matching table entry X to at
most Y bytes per second", this is _not_ an embarrassingly parallel
problem.  It could be done by coordinating state between the
pipelines, e.g. using something like cache coherency protocols
commonly implemented within multi-core CPUs, or by "moving the packets
to where the shared state is", e.g. recirculating packets to a common
pipeline where the meter state is kept.  Both of these techniques lead
to lower packet processing performance, at least in some cases, and
both add complexity to the system.  It is typical in network switches
to simply maintain the meter state independently in each pipeline and
not coordinate it, and accept the resulting behavior.

This issue is not specific to packet switches.  It falls under the
category of accessing mutable state in a distributed system, with not
only correctness concerns, but very strong performance concerns.

The `Register` extern is more general in its capability than meters,
and the same potential issue of state being split across multiple
pipelines exists.  It is recommended that you talk to your PSA device
vendor about this issue if it could affect features you wish to write
in your P4 program.  If a PSA device does not implement automatic
coherency for such state, common strategies are the same as mentioned
above for meters: accept the resulting behavior of the independently
maintained state in each pipeline, or move the relevant packets to one
place where the state is maintained.

Note that the proposed `psa_idle_timeout` table property introduces a
way by which doing table `apply` operations _does_ update state within
a P4 table.  Each table entry requires at least one, and more likely several, bits of state to represent a "last matched time" value, and this value is updated with every `apply` operation.  If this state in
tables with this option is not automatically coordinated between
pipelines, then it can differ for corresponding
table entries in different pipelines.  An entry with key X in one
pipeline could remain unmatched for longer than the desired timeout,
at the same time that the corresponding entries with key X are
recently matched in other pipelines.  One possible approach to handle
this is for the PSA device and its implementation-specific control
software to make the existence of multiple pipelines explicit to the
control plane software in some way, e.g. assign each pipeline, and the
tables and externs it contains, a distinct name.

For programming multiple pipelines, it is the responsibility of the
vendor and of target dependent tools to specify how PSA programs are
mapped to multiple pipelines.  An implementation may use a copy of the
PSA program on each pipeline, thus keeping pipelines fully isolated.


# Appendix: Packet ordering {#appendix-packet-ordering}

This section describes _recommendations_ for PSA implementations on
the order that packets are processed.  These are not requirements,
since there are known implementation techniques, especially
parallelism that can be taken advantage of in a variety of ways, that
can lead to cheaper implementations if these recommendations are not
followed.  We recommend that developers selecting P4 devices ask their
designers about these issues, if those developers consider the issues
important for their purposes.

Recommendation 1: Packets that arrive on the same input port should
begin ingress processing in the same relative order as they arrived.

Recommendation 2: Packets that go out on the same output port should
be transmitted on the port in the same relative order that they began
egress processing.

Recommendation 3: PRE unicast packets (i.e. those that follow the
"enqueue one packet" path in the pseudocode of section
[#sec-after-ingress]) that arrived from the same ingress port, did
ingress processing once (i.e. were not resubmitted or recirculated),
were sent to the PRE with the same `class_of_service` value, and
destined for the same egress port, should begin egress processing in
the same relative order as they began ingress processing.

It is expected that some PSA implementations will implement the class
of service mechanism by having a separate FIFO queue per class of
service, and thus while unicast packets with the same ingress port,
egress port, and class of service will pass through the system in FIFO
order if they follow all recommendations above, unicast packets with
the same ingress and egress port, but different classes of service,
may be processed by the egress control block in a different order than
they were processed by the ingress control block.

If an implementation satisfies recommendations 1 through 3, then
unicast traffic assigned to the same class of service will maintain
its relative order through the device.

Recommendation 4: Consider PRE multicast packets (i.e. those that
follow the "Make 0 or more copies" path in the pseudocode of section
[#sec-after-ingress]) that arrived on the same ingress port, did
ingress processing once, and were sent to the PRE with the same pair
of values (`class_of_service`, `multicast_group`).  For copies of
those original packets that are destined to the same egress port, and
with the same pair of values for (`egress_port`, `instance`), those
copies should begin egress processing in the same relative order as
the original packets began ingress processing.

There is no such expectation for multicast packets with different
`class_of_service` values, again because of separate queues in the PRE
for different `class_of_service` values.

It is also understood that for a short period of time after the
control plane modifies the set of copies to be made for a particular
`multicast_group` value, that it may be especially difficult to
satisfy Recommendation 4.  That recommendation is intended to apply
only when the set of copies to be made for the multicast group has
remained unchanged for a period of time.

If an implementation satisfies recommendations 1, 2, and 4, then
multicast traffic assigned to the same class of service will maintain
its relative order through the device, when multicast group membership
has been stable for long enough.

Note that there is no recommendation to enforce any relative ingress
to egress processing order of unicast packets vs. multicast packets.
Commonly used mechanisms for creating multicast copies in the PRE
allow unicast packets to "go around" the packet replication logic,
which is unnecessary for unicast packets, and thus change the relative
order of such packets there.  Also, it is common in packet buffers to
use separate queues for multicast traffic versus unicast.


We give some motivations for these recommendations below.

1. Expectations of hosts

While the Internet Protocol does not have strong ordering requirements
for sequences of packets sent by one host to another, there are still
widely deployed implementations of TCP that lead to significantly
degraded throughput when the network frequently delivers packets to
the receiver in a different order than they were transmitted.  While
significant research and development has been done to mitigate this
issue, e.g. later Linux TCP implementations (since 2011 when version
2.6.35 was released) are much more resilient to this problem than
earlier versions, there are still many commonly deployed TCP
implementations that suffer from this issue.  See references within
Kandula et al's work[^Kandula2007] for some of the research done
towards making TCP more robust in the face of network packet
reordering.

Such TCP implementations interpret acknowledgements with repeated
cumulative acknowledgement sequence numbers as a likely indication of
packet loss in the network, and reduce their sending window in an
effort to avoid network congestion.

While applications using UDP should also be aware of possible packet
reordering in a network, some of them behave poorly if this reordering
becomes common[^LG2002].

These expectations of hosts are a significant reason why ECMP (Equal
Cost Multi Path) path selection and LAG (Link Aggregation Group) link
selection are so often done by using a hash of packet header fields
such as IP source and destination address, and TCP or UDP source and
destination port.  Choosing among parallel paths in this way helps to
preserve the order of packets in the same application flow, at the
cost of not balancing the load as evenly as possible.  If a network
device's internal implementation reordered packets, it would be an
independent source of network reordering.

[^Kandula2007]: S. Kandula, D. Katabi, S. Sinha, and A. Berger, "Dynamic load balancing without packet reordering", ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, Vol. 37, No. 2, April 2007
[^LG2002]: M. Laor and L. Gendel, "The effect of packet reordering in a backbone link on application throghput", IEEE Network, 2002.


2. Implementation of stateful protocols

This reason is much less significant than the previous one.  We
mention it here primarily so implementers of networking protocols are
aware of the issue.  This issue is only relevant for a relatively
small fraction of network protocols.

Some networking protocols add sequence numbers to packets, and require
either dropping packets that arrive out of sequence number order at a
later network point (e.g. GRE with sequence numbers enabled), or with
a looser check that allows some amount of network reordering to occur
without dropping the packets (e.g. IPsec).  When a device implementing
these protocols does the sequence number insertion or checking in a
different order than packets are sent or received on a physical port,
that is effectively another kind of network reordering that can affect
the performance of these protocols.

Similarly, there are some protocols like IP header compression, where
multiple variants have been developed, some with more or less
robustness in the face of network reordering.


# Appendix: Supporting empty action selector groups {#appendix-empty-action-selector-groups}

As mentioned in Section [#sec-action-selector], a PSA data plane
implementation need not implement any specific defined behavior if one
attempts to add a table entry for a key that points at a group that is
currently empty.

Some P4 users have expressed an interest in enabling a P4Runtime
client (hereafter called the controller) to remove the last member of
an action selector group, and have the data plane behave in a
predictable way.

For example, if one has a table that maps logical interface id numbers
to physical port numbers, using an action selector to implement LAG
(Link Aggregation Group), what should the controller do when there was
only one physical port in a LAG that was enabled, and that port goes
down?  A straightforward desired behavior from the controller's
perspective is: issue the P4Runtime command to remove the last member
from the group, and have an empty group action of "drop the packet"
take effect for any packets applying the table and selecting the empty
group.

Fully supporting empty action groups should meet all of these
requirements:

- All P4Runtime API operations such as adding a member to a group
  (even when changing from empty to 1 member), removing a member from
  a group (even when changing from 1 member to empty), modifying the
  action associated with a member, etc. should be atomic relative to
  data packet processing.  That is, every packet should be processed
  as if the table was in the old state, or the new state, with no
  undefined packet processing behavior.
- The empty group action that is executed when the matching table
  entry points at an empty group, may have an action name that is the
  same as, or different than, the action name used by the group when
  it was non-empty (if it was non-empty, and then became empty by
  removing its last member).

A high performance implementation will also be able to make changes to
group membership using a number of data plane update operations that
does not grow with the number of table entries that point at the
group.

Achieving all of these requirements seems not to be possible with a
PSA data plane implementation that meets only the minimum requirements
for action selectors, i.e. one that restricts members of a group to
all have the same action name, and that does not natively support
predictable behavior if a group is empty in the data plane.

Below we describe one way that achieves the goals above, but only for
a data plane implementation that supports multiple different action
names in the same group at the same time.  For a data plane that does
not support this, the idea only _nearly_ achieves the goal.  It
requires the empty group action to have the same action name as the
non-empty groups of the action selector.  This may be too onerous of a
restriction on system developers to be worth implementing.

This behavior can be implemented via a small extra bit of logic in the
P4Runtime server implementation (hereafter called the agent).  The
basic idea is that the agent obtains the empty group action, with
action parameter values, e.g. from the compiled representation of the
P4 program.

If no table entry currently "points at" an empty group G, then G's
empty group action need not be installed anywhere in the data plane.
Similarly if G is currently non-empty, and there are table entries
currently pointing at G.

Suppose there is currently one member in G, and G is pointed at by at
least one table entry.  The controller issues a command to remove that
only member from G.

The agent can implement this command by the following sequence of
changes in the data plane:

1. Add to G a new member, which is the empty group action.  Now in the
   data plane, for a short time, G contains two members.
2. Remove from G the member that the controller requested to be
   removed.  Now the data plane version of G has only one member
   containing the empty group action, so all packets using G will execute
   that action.

When G is currently empty as far as the controller is concerned (but
contains one member pointing at the empty group action in the data
plane), and the controller adds one member to it, the agent can
implement this via these steps:

1. Add to G the member requested by the controller.  The data plane
   temporarily has two members for G, including the empty group action.
2. Remove from G the empty group action.  Now G in the data plane is back
   to the one member that the controller wants.

A PSA implementation with an agent that implements empty action
selector groups in this way must implement each of the two steps for
such transitions in an atomic way, as described in Section
[#sec-atomicity-of-control-plane-api-operations], but it is allowed
for one or more packets to be processed in the intermediate state that
exists between the two steps.

If a PSA implementation supports multiple different action names in
the same group at the same time, then there is no need to read
further.  Below we only describe what might be done for a data plane
that restricts each group to contain only actions with the same action
name.

Because a PSA implementation need not support multiple different
action types in the same action selector group at the same time
(mentioned in Section [#sec-action-selector]), a developer wishing to
take advantage of this in a portable way may need to modify one or
more of the actions used in their tables that use action selectors.

For example, if in the LAG port selection example mentioned earlier,
there was only one action for a table `lag` defined like this:

```
    action set_output_port (PortId_t p) {
        user_meta.out_port = p;
    }
    ActionProfile(128) ap;
    table lag {
        key = {
            // ... key fields go here ...
        }
        actions = { set_output_port; }
        psa_implementation = ap;
    }

    control cIngress (
                inout headers hdr,
                inout metadata user_meta,
                in    psa_ingress_input_metadata_t  istd_meta,
                inout psa_ingress_output_metadata_t ostd_meta
    ) {
        apply {
            // ... earlier ingress code goes here ...
            lag.apply();
            send_to_port(ostd_meta, user_meta.out_port);
            // ... later ingress code goes here ...
        }
    }
```

with a single action parameter equal to a physical port number of the
device, one of the following approaches could be used, and of course
there are likely to be other approaches not mentioned here.

+ Approach 1: Use an invalid port number

Pick a value of type `PortId_t` that corresponds to no valid physical
port of the device (TBD whether PSA should define such a value with a
name -- it currently doesn't guarantee that such a value even exists
for type `PortId_t`) and use that value for the empty group action of an
empty group.  In the code after `lag.apply`, add an `if` statement
checking for that invalid value, like this:

```
        apply {
            // ... earlier ingress code goes here ...
            lag.apply();
            if (user_meta.out_port == PORT_INVALID_VALUE) {
                ingress_drop(ostd_meta);
            } else {
                send_to_port(ostd_meta, user_meta.out_port);
            }
            // ... later ingress code goes here ...
        }
```

+ Approach 2: Add extra parameters to the action

In this case, add a 1-bit parameter indicating whether to drop the
packet later.  An `if` statement is still needed after applying the
table.

```
    action set_output_port (PortId_t p, bit<1> drop) {
        user_meta.out_port = p;
        user_meta.drop = drop;
    }

    // ...

        apply {
            // ... earlier ingress code goes here ...
            lag.apply();
            if (user_meta.drop == 1) {
                ingress_drop(ostd_meta);
            } else {
                send_to_port(ostd_meta, user_meta.out_port);
            }
            // ... later ingress code goes here ...
        }
```

In either case, an implementation might also support putting the `if`
statement inside of the action `set_output_port`, but this is not
required by PSA.

+-----+-----+-----+


## Changes made in version 1.2


### Add match_kind `optional`

This match kind was added to the v1model architecture in early 2020,
and seems useful in that it (a) provides additional information about
how the control plane plans to configure the matching rules of a
table, and (b) the additional restrictions it has over match kind
`ternary` provides opportunities for target devices to implement it
more efficiently than `ternary`.


## Changes made in version 1.1


### Numeric translation between P4Runtime API values and data plane values

There was a series of meetings after PSA v1.0 was released to refine
the details of the plan to do numeric translation of values with type
`PortId_t` (and `ClassOfService_t`, and optionally other types in the
future).  PSA v1.1 reflects the latest design for how to accomplish
this.  Changes can be found here:

+ Section 4.1 "PSA type definitions"
+ Section 4.4 "Data plane vs. control plane data representations"


### Add the ability for packet clone sessions to create multiple copies

In PSA v1.0, requesting to make a clone of a packet was restricted to
creating a single clone, sent to a single output port.  In PSA v1.1
you may now configure a clone session with a set of
`(egress_port, instance)` pairs, similar to how a multicast group can
be configured.  Changes can be found here:

+ Section 6.2. "Behavior of packets after ingress processing is complete"
+ Section 6.4.5 "Multicast and clone copies" (formerly called "Multicast copies")
+ Section 6.5 "Behavior of packets after egress processing is complete"
+ Section 6.8 "Packet Cloning"


### Add psa_idle_timeout table property

Adding this brings PSA v1.1 up to date with the support for this
feature in the P4Runtime API.  Using this table property enables the
P4 developer to specify that a table must maintain some state of when
the last time each table entry was matched, and if an entry remains
unmatched for longer than a time configured by the controller, then a
notification message should be sent to the controller.

+ Section 7.2.1 "Table entry timeout notification"


### Add psa_empty_group_action table property

PSA v1.0 did not specify the behavior of a table with an
`ActionSelector` implementation, if a packet matched a table entry
that was configured with an empty action selector group.

PSA v1.1 recommends (but does not require) that implementations
support a new `psa_empty_group_action` table property, whose value is
an action that should be executed when this situation occurs.

+ Section 7.12 "Action Selector"


### Other changes

In PSA v1.0, the `Digest` extern was required to be supported in both
the `IngressDeparser` and `EgressDeparser` control blocks.  It is now
no longer required to be supported in the `EgressDeparser` control
block.

+ Table 5 "Summary of controls that can instantiate and invoke externs"


### Changes to the psa.p4 include file

+ Updates for the latest plan on P4Runtime API numerical translation
  of type `PortId_t` and `ClassOfService_t`.
+ Eliminate obsolete `ValueSet` extern, because the `value_set`
  construct was added to the P4~16~ language specification in version
  1.1.0.
+ Fix a few typos in example control plane APIs in comments.
+ Eliminate `PSA_SWITCH` `#define` macro with arguments, since the
  P4~16~ language spec does not require that the P4~16~ preprocessor
  support such macros.


### Changes to example PSA programs in the `p4-16/psa/examples` directory

+ Small changes required to bring them in harmony with the latest
  details on P4Runtime API numerical translation of type `PortId_t`.
