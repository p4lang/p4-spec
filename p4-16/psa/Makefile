# Disabling warnings about uninitialized_out_param, because those
# regularly occur with these example programs for the 'out
# psa_parser_output_metadata_t ostd' parameter of the parsers.

# TBD: The lines commented out below are PSA example programs that
# have not yet been updated for the proposed new way of handling
# recirculate, resubmit, clone, and normal (aka bridged metadata)
# preserved metadata.

# Most of those commented out programs would look much like
# psa-example-drop-all.p4 in the changes required, since they do not
# preserve any metadata for those cases.

# psa-example-parser-error-handling.p4 does need some updates, most
# likely ones that look nearly identical to
# psa-example-parser-error-handling.p4

# of 2018-Oct-19, the latest version of p4test gives an error if you
# attempt this, I believe somewhere in one of the mid end passes.  It
# is definitely not in the bmv2 back end code.
